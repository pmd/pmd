/**
 * An ambiguous name occurring in any context. Without a disambiguation
 * pass that taking care of obscuring rules and the current declarations
 * in scope, this node could be a type, package, or variable name -we
 * can't know for sure. The node is a placeholder for that unknown entity.
 * It implements both {@link ASTType} and {@link ASTPrimaryExpression} to
 * be able to be inserted in their hierarchy (maybe that should be changed
 * though).
 *
 * <p>This node corresponds simultaneously to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-6.html#jls-AmbiguousName">AmbiguousName</a>
 * and PackageOrTypeName productions of the JLS.
 *
 * <pre class="grammar">
 *
 * AmbiguousNameExpr ::= &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; ( "." &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt;)*
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * @implNote <h3>Disambiguation</h3>
 *
 * <p>Some ambiguous names are pushed by the expression parser because
 * we don't want to look too far ahead (in primary prefix). But it can
 * happen that the next segment (primary suffix) constrains the name to
 * be e.g. a type name or an expression name. E.g. From the JLS:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * A name is syntactically classified as an ExpressionName in these contexts:
 *   ...
 * - As the qualifying expression in a qualified class instance creation
 *  expression (ยง15.9)
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * We don't know at the moment the name is parsed that it will be
 * followed by "." "new" and a constructor call. But as soon as the
 * {@link ASTConstructorCall} is pushed, we know that the LHS must be an
 * expression. In that case, the name can be reclassified, and e.g. if
 * it's a simple name be promoted to {@link ASTVariableAccess}. This
 * type of immediate disambiguation is carried out by the {@link AbstractJavaNode#jjtClose()}
 * method of those nodes that do force a specific context on their
 * left-hand side. See also {@link LeftRecursiveNode}.
 *
 * <p>Another mechanism is {@link #forceExprContext()} and {@link #forceTypeContext()},
 * which are called by the parser to promote an ambiguous name to an
 * expression or a type when exiting from the {@link JavaParserImpl#PrimaryExpression()}
 * production or {@link JavaParserImpl#ClassOrInterfaceType()}.
 *
 * <p>Those two mechanisms perform the first classification step, the
 * one that only depends on the syntactic context and not on semantic
 * information. A second pass on the AST after building the symbol tables
 * would allow us to remove all the remaining ambiguous names.
