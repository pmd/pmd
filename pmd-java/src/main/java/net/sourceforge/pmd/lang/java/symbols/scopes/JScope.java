/**
 * A symbol table for a piece of Java code. Keeps track of the types, values, and
 * methods accessible from their simple name in the extent of the scope.
 *
 * <p>Each scope is linked to a parent scope, and keeps track of a particular set
 * of declarations having the same relative precedence. When a scope is asked for
 * the meaning of a name in a particular context (type name, method name, value name),
 * it first determines if it has a declaration with a matching name.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If there is one, it returns the {@link JCodeReference} representing the entity
 *      the name stands for in the given context
 *     <li>If there is none, it asks the same question to the parent scope recursively
 *      and returns its result.
 * </ul>
 * This allows directly encoding shadowing and hiding mechanisms in the parent-child
 * relationships.
 *
 * <p>Each compilation unit defines a tree of scopes, somewhat corresponding to the
 * logical structure of the compilation unit. The following describes the most general
 * form of the upper part of the scope tree (before the first type declaration), in increasing
 * order of precedence:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> {@link ImportOnDemandScope}: Types imported from a package or type by an import-on-demand,
 *     and static method or field names imported from a type by a static-import-on-demand;
 *     <li> {@link JavaLangScope}: Top-level types implicitly imported from {@literal java.lang};
 *     <li> {@link SamePackageScope}: Top-level types from the same package, which are implicitly imported
 *     <li> {@link SingleImportScope}: types imported by single-type-imports, and static methods and
 *     fields imported by a single-static-import.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that the root of the tree is actually {@link JavaLangScope} for all compilation units, because
 * we use a singleton to avoid duplicating it. The above precedence order is nevertheless respected.
