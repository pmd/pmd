/**
 * Scope defined by the declaration of a type, a variable, a method.
 * Keeps track of the types, values, and methods accessible from their
 * simple name in the extent of the scope.
 *
 * <p>Scopes are linked to their parent scope, and are only responsible for
 * the declarations occurring in their extent. When a scope can't find a
 * declaration, it delegates to its parent. This encodes shadowing and
 * hiding mechanisms transparently.
 *
 * <p>A class scope contains the field and method declarations of the class, and
 * is linked to an inherited scope that represents methods, types and values that
 * are inherited from its supertypes. It doesn't contain them directly.
 *
 *
 * <p>The following describes the most general form of the scope tree of a compilation unit.
 * Higher in the list means higher in the tree, i.e., lower precedence. Note that {@link ImportOnDemandScope}
 * has
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link JavaLangScope}
 * <li> {@link ImportOnDemandScope}: never shadow anything, is shadowed by everything (see javadoc for why it's not the root)
 * <li> {@link SamePackageScope}: shadow imports-on-demands, is shadowed by single imports and lower
 * <li> {@link SingleImportScope}: shadows all of the above, is shadowed by type definitions of this compilation unit
 * </ul>*
