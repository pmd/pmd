### 🚀️ New and noteworthy

### 🌟️ New and Changed Rules
#### New Rules
*   The new java rule  [`LongLiteralEndingWithLowercaseL`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.28.0-SNAPSHOT/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#longliteralendingwithlowercasel) finds long literals ending with l.
    That helps to avoid confusion between numbers ending with 1 and l. Capital L should be used to define long literals.
*   The new java rule  [`TypeNameMismatch`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.28.0-SNAPSHOT/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#typenamemismatch) finds types that are not defined in a .java file
    with the same name. Enforcing a match between source file name and type name makes it easier to
    find source code for given type.
*   The new Java rule [`CStyleArrayDeclaration`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.28.0-SNAPSHOT/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#cstylearraydeclaration) finds C-style declarations of arrays (e.g. `int numbers[]`).
    That helps you use Java-style declarations (e.g. `int[] numbers`) consistently throughout the codebase.
#### Changed Rules
*   The property `checkNonStaticMethods` of the rule [`NonThreadSafeSingleton`](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.28.0-SNAPSHOT/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#nonthreadsafesingleton) is now
    deprecated and no longer has any effect. Its implementation did the opposite of what the documentation described.
    The rule now always reports both static and non-static methods; previously it reported only static methods
    by default.  
    This may result in additional violations being reported.  
    If you want to suppress violations for non-static methods, you can use
    [suppression via XPath](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.28.0-SNAPSHOT/pmd_userdocs_suppressing_warnings.html#the-property-violationsuppressxpath), e.g.
    ```xml
    <property name="violationSuppressXPath" value=".[ancestor-or-self::MethodDeclaration[1][@Static = false()]]" />
    ```
