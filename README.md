### How to build PMD?

You'll need to have a `~/.m2/toolchains.xml` file setup with jdk 1.6 (for pmd 5.3.x), jdk 1.7 (for pmd 5.4.x and pmd 5.5.x)
and jdk 1.8 (for some features in pmd 5.5.x). See [maven toolchains](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html).
A example file can be found here: [example-toolchains.xml](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/example-toolchains.xml).

Use maven in the top-level directory:

    mvn clean package

This will create the zip files in the directory `pmd-dist/target`:

    cd pmd-dist/target
    ls *.zip

That's all !

### How to build the documentation (maven site)?

Building the maven site is done with the following commands:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
    mvn install site site:stage -Psite

You'll find the built site in the directory `target/staging/`.

### Bug Reports

We are using Sourceforge for bug tracking. Please file your bugs at <https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/>.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are always welcome: <https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pulls>

### Code Style

PMD uses checkstyle to enforce a common code style.

See [pmd-checkstyle-config.xml](https://github.com/pmd/build-tools/blob/master/config/src/main/resources/net/sourceforge/pmd/pmd-checkstyle-config.xml) for the configuration and
[the eclipse configuration files](https://github.com/pmd/build-tools/tree/master/config/eclipse) that can
be imported into a fresh workspace.
