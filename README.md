# Tacit Knowledge fork of PMD.  https://github.com/pmd/pmd.git

This fork supports a couple new CPD features for Java projects
    1. ignoreAnnotations to skip CPD processing of annotations. Annotations often create many redundant lines and false positives.
    2. @SuppressWarnings("CPD-START")
There's a pull request with more information on these. 
    https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/6 

## Why the fork?

Its temporary and we'd like to retire the fork.  

    1. We have a pull request open: https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/6 
    2. Once that gets done, we'll look forward to the new maven library being released 

## Samples

```
    //enable suppression
    @SuppressWarnings("CPD-START")
    public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod(int x) throws Exception {

    }
    //disable suppression
    @SuppressWarnings("CPD-END)
    public void nextMethod() {
    }
```

To disable annotations, add ignore_annotations=true to the cpd properties.  Just like ignore_literals


## Start Using It?
If you can't wait for this to get integrated into the main pmd project, you can start now.
Feel free to pull and build it.  Additionally you can include it in your Maven project via: 
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tacitknowledge</groupId>
    <artifactId>pmd</artifactId>
    <name>PMD</name>
    <!-- version below matches the tag at https://github.com/tacitknowledge/pmd.git on the tkpmd branch -->
    <version>5.1.0-TK-1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
