        <description>
The complexity of methods directly affects maintenance costs and readability. Concentrating too much decisional logic
in a single method makes its behaviour hard to read and change.

Cyclomatic complexity assesses the complexity of a method by counting the number of decision points in a method,
plus one for the method entry. Decision points are places where the control flow jumps to another place in the
program. As such, they include all control flow statements, such as 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case'.

Generally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote
high complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity. By default, this rule reports methods with a complexity >= 10.
Additionnally, classes with many methods of moderate complexity get reported as well once the total of their
methods' complexities reaches 40, even if none of the methods was directly reported.

Reported methods should be broken down into several smaller methods. Reported classes should probably be broken down
into subcomponents.

        <description>
Methods that are highly complex are difficult to read and more costly to maintain. If you include too much decisional
logic within a single method, you make its behavior hard to understand and more difficult to modify.

Cognitive complexity is a measure of how difficult it is for humans to read and understand a method. Code that contains
a break in the control flow is more complex, whereas the use of language shorthands doesn't increase the level of
complexity. Nested control flows can make a method more difficult to understand, with each additional nesting of the
control flow leading to an increase in cognitive complexity.

Information about Cognitive complexity can be found in the original paper here:
https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf

By default, this rule reports methods with a complexity of 15 or more. Reported methods should be broken down into less
complex components.

Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessive
responsibilities that could be provided by external classes or functions. In breaking these methods
apart the code becomes more managable and ripe for reuse.

Classes with large numbers of public methods and attributes require disproportionate testing efforts
since combinational side effects grow rapidly and increase risk. Refactoring these classes into
smaller ones not only increases testability and reliability but also allows new variations to be
developed easily.
