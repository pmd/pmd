### Short term (before next release)
###

When Exclude/Include patterns are modified at workspace, should take immediate effect on Projects.

###
### Medium term (following release, or soon after)
###

Refactor plugin projects.  Do we really need 5 projects?  Can we get by with 2?
There's a whole lot of layers, can we simply things a bit?

###
### Long term (wish list)
###

Upgrade plugin code to Java 5.

Allow import of a single rule from a RuleSet.
Warn if Import of a Rule results in a duplicate (what is a duplicate exactly?), allow option to Import All, Import Non Duplicates, or Cancel.
Warn if newly Added Rule has the name of an existing Rule.
Warn if non reference Rule looks like it might be a built-in PMD rule, and ask if replace with reference.  On Add?  On Import?  On Upgrade?
Add Upgrade button, which will check current workspace RuleSet against PMD rules showing differences (new PMD rules, rules in
Allow checking to see what rules from PMD are missing (useful for upgrade process).
Allow auto-enabling newly added/imported Rules in Projects which are not using custom RuleSet, currently they are not selected.
Allow custom RuleSet editing to also take place at project level, instead of just at Workspace level.
