## ðŸš€ Major Features and Enhancements

### New official logo

Many of you probably have already seen the new logo, but now it's time to actually ship it. The new logo
was long ago decided (see [#1663](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1663)).

We decided it's time to have a modernized logo and get rid of the gun. This allows to include
the logo anywhere without offense.

The official logo is also without a tagline (such as "Code Quality Matters!") as the tagline created some
controversies. Without a tagline, we are not limited in the direction of future development of PMD.

The new logo is available from the [Logo Project Page](pmd_projectdocs_logo.html).

### Revamped Java

The Java grammar has been refactored substantially in order to make it easier to maintain and more correct
regarding the Java Language Specification. It supports now also the edge-cases where PMD 6 was failing
(e.g. annotations were not supported everywhere). Changing the grammar entails a changed AST and therefore changed
rules. The PMD built-in rules have all been upgraded and many bugs have been fixed on the way.
Unfortunately, if you are using custom rules, you will most probably need to accommodate these changes yourself.

The type resolution framework has been rewritten from scratch and should now cover the entire Java spec correctly.
The same is true for the symbol table.
PMD 6 on the other hand has always had problems with advanced type inference, e.g. with lambdas and call chains.
Since it was built on the core reflection API, it also was prone to linkage errors and classloader leaks for instance.
PMD 7 does not need to load classes, and does not have these problems.

The AST exposes much more semantic information now. For instance, you can jump from a method call to
the declaration of the method being called, or from a field access to the field declaration. These
improvements allow interesting rules to be written that need precise knowledge of the types
in the program, for instance to detect {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryBoxing %}
or {% rule java/codestyle/UseDiamondOperator %}.
These are just a small preview of the new rules we will be adding in the PMD 7 release cycle.

Overall, the changes to the parser, AST, type resolution and symbol table code has made PMD for
Java **significantly faster**. On average, we have seen ~2-3X faster analysis, but as usual, this may change
depending on your workload, configuration and ruleset.

{% include note.html content="
The full detailed documentation of the changes are still work in progress.

Some first results of the Java AST changes are for now documented in the Wiki:
[Java clean changes](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Java_clean_changes).

It is planned to move the contents of the wiki page into this document before the final release of PMD 7.

#### Annotations

Annotations are consolidated into a single node. `SingleMemberAnnotation`, `NormalAnnotation` and `MarkerAnnotation`
are removed in favour of {% jdoc jast::ASTAnnotation %}. The Name node is removed, replaced by a
{% jdoc jast::ASTClassOrInterfaceType %}.

Those different node types implement a syntax-only distinction, that only makes semantically equivalent annotations
have different possible representations. For example, `@A` and `@A()` are semantically equivalent, yet they were
parsed as MarkerAnnotation resp. NormalAnnotation. Similarly, `@A("")` and `@A(value="")` were parsed as
SingleMemberAnnotation resp. NormalAnnotation. This also makes parsing much simpler. The nested ClassOrInterface
type is used to share the disambiguation logic.

#### Types

* {% jdoc jast::ASTType %} and {% jdoc jast::ASTReferenceType %} have been turned into
  interfaces, implemented by {% jdoc jast::ASTPrimitiveType %}, {% jdoc jast::ASTClassOrInterfaceType %},
  and the new node {% jdoc jast::ASTArrayType %}. This reduces the depth of the relevant
  subtrees, and allows to explore them more easily and consistently.

* {% jdoc jast::ASTClassOrInterfaceType %} appears to be left recursive now.
  TODO document that when we're done discussing the semantic rewrite phase.

* **Migrating**
  * There is currently no way to match abstract types (or interfaces) with XPath, so `Type`
    and `ReferenceType` name tests won't match anything anymore.
  * `Type/ReferenceType/ClassOrInterfaceType` -> `ClassOrInterfaceType`
  * `Type/PrimitiveType` -> `PrimitiveType`.
  * `Type/ReferenceType[@ArrayDepth>1]/ClassOrInterfaceType` -> `ArrayType/ClassOrInterfaceType`.
  * `Type/ReferenceType/PrimitiveType` -> `ArrayType/PrimitiveType`.
  * Note that in most cases you should check the type of a variable with e.g.
    `VariableDeclaratorId[pmd-java:typeIs("java.lang.String[]")]` because it
    considers the additional dimensions on declarations like `String foo[];`.
    The Java equivalent is `TypeHelper.isA(id, String[].class);`

#### Declarations

TODO

#### Statements

TODO

#### Expressions

* {% jdoc jast::ASTExpression %} and {% jdoc jast::ASTPrimaryExpression %} have
  been turned into interfaces. These added no information to the AST and increased
  its depth unnecessarily. All expressions implement the first interface. Both of
  those nodes can no more be found in ASTs.

* **Migrating**:
  * Basically, `Expression/X` or `Expression/PrimaryExpression/X`, just becomes `X`
  * There is currently no way to match abstract or interface types with XPath, so `Expression` or `PrimaryExpression` 
    name tests won't match anything anymore. However, the axis step *[@Expression=true()] matches any expression.

* {% jdoc jast::ASTLiteral %} has been turned into an interface. The fact that {% jdoc jast::ASTNullLiteral %}
  and {% jdoc jast::ASTBooleanLiteral %} were nested within it but other literals types were all directly represented
  by it was inconsistent, and ultimately that level of nesting was unnecessary.
  * {% jdoc jast::ASTNumericLiteral %}, {% jdoc jast::ASTCharLiteral %}, {% jdoc jast::ASTStringLiteral %},
    and {% jdoc jast::ASTClassLiteral %} are new nodes that implement that interface.
  * ASTLiteral implements {% jdoc jast::ASTPrimaryExpression %}

* **Migrating**:
  * Remove all `/Literal/` segments from your XPath expressions
  * If you tested several types of literals, you can e.g. do it like `/*[self::StringLiteral or self::CharLiteral]/`
  * As is usual, use the designer to explore the new AST structure

* The nodes {% jdoc_old jast::ASTPrimaryPrefix %} and {% jdoc_old jast::ASTPrimarySuffix %} are removed from the
  grammar. Subtrees for primary expressions appear to be left-recursive now. For example,

```java
new Foo().bar.foo(1)
```
used to be parsed as
```
Expression
+ PrimaryExpression
  + PrimaryPrefix
    + AllocationExpression
      + ClassOrInterfaceType[@Image="Foo"]
  + PrimarySuffix
    + Arguments
  + PrimarySuffix
    + Name[@Image="bar.foo"]
  + PrimarySuffix
    + Arguments
      + ArgumentsList
        + Expression
          + PrimaryExpression
            + Literal[@ValueAsInt=1]
```
It's now parsed as
```
MethodCall[@MethodName="foo"]
+ FieldAccess[@FieldName="bar"]
  + ConstructorCall
    + ClassOrInterfaceType[@TypeImage="Foo"]
    + ArgumentsList
+ ArgumentsList
  + NumericLiteral[@ValueAsInt=1]
```
Instead of being flat, the subexpressions are now nested within one another.
The nesting follows the naturally recursive structure of expressions:

```java
new Foo().bar.foo(1)
---------            ConstructorCall
-------------        FieldAccess
-------------------- MethodCall
```
This makes the AST more regular and easier to navigate. Each node contains
the other nodes that are relevant to it (e.g. arguments) instead of them
being spread out over several siblings. The API of all nodes has been
enriched with high-level accessors to query the AST in a semantic way,
without bothering with the placement details.

The amount of changes in the grammar that this change entails is enormous,
but hopefully firing up the designer to inspect the new structure should
give you the information you need quickly.

TODO write a summary of changes in the javadoc of the package, will be more
accessible.

Note: this doesn't affect binary expressions like {% jdoc jast::ASTAdditiveExpression %}.
E.g. `a+b+c` is not parsed as
```
AdditiveExpression
+ AdditiveExpression
  + (a)
  + (b)
+ (c)  
``` 
It's still
```
AdditiveExpression
+ (a)
+ (b)
+ (c)  
``` 
which is easier to navigate, especially from XPath.

### Revamped Command Line Interface

PMD now ships with a unified Command Line Interface for both Linux/Unix and Windows. Instead of having a collection
of scripts for the different utilities shipped with PMD, a single script `pmd` (`pmd.bat` for Windows) can now
launch all utilities using subcommands, e.g. `pmd check`, `pmd designer`. All commands and options are thoroughly
documented in the help, with full color support where available. Moreover, efforts were made to provide consistency
in the usage of all PMD utilities.

```shell
$ Usage: pmd [-hV] [COMMAND]
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  check     The PMD standard source code analyzer
  cpd       Copy/Paste Detector - find duplicate code
  designer  The PMD visual rule designer
  cpd-gui   GUI for the Copy/Paste Detector
              Warning: May not support the full CPD feature set
  ast-dump  Experimental: dumps the AST of parsing source code
Exit Codes:
  0   Successful analysis, no violations found
  1   An unexpected error occurred during execution
  2   Usage error, please refer to the command help
  4   Successful analysis, at least 1 violation found
```

For instance, where you previously would have run
```shell
run.sh pmd -d src -R ruleset.xml
```
you should now use
```shell
pmd check -d src -R ruleset.xml
```
or even better, omit using `-d` / `--dir` and simply pass the sources at the end of the parameter list

```shell
pmd check -R ruleset.xml src
```

Multiple source directories can be passed, such as:
```shell
pmd check -R ruleset.xml src/main/java src/test/java
```

And the exact same applies to CPD:
```shell
pmd cpd --minimum-tokens 100 src/main/java
```

Additionally, the CLI for the `check` command has been enhanced with a progress bar, which interactively displays the
current progress of the analysis.

![Demo](images/userdocs/pmd-demo.gif)

This can be disabled with the `--no-progress` flag.

Finally, we now provide a completion script for Bash/Zsh to further help daily usage.
This script can be found under `shell/pmd-completion.sh` in the binary distribution.
To use it, edit your `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` file and add the following line:

```
source *path_to_pmd*/shell/pmd-completion.sh
```

### Full Antlr support

PMD 6 only supported JavaCC based grammars, but with [Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) parsers
can be generated as well. Languages backed by an Antlr grammar are now fully supported. This means, it's now
possible not only to use Antlr grammars for CPD, but we can actually build full-fledged PMD rules for them as well.
Both the traditional Java visitor rules, and the simpler XPath rules are available to users. This allows
to leverage existing grammars.

We expect this to enable both our dev team and external contributors to largely extend PMD usage for more languages.

Two languages (Swift and Kotlin) already use this new possibility.

### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/7.0.0-rc1).

#### New CPD report format cpdhtml-v2.xslt

Thanks to @mohan-chinnappan-n a new CPD report format has been added which features a data table.
It uses an XSLT stylesheet to convert CPD's XML format into HTML.

See [the example report](report-examples/cpdhtml-v2.html).

## ðŸŽ‰ Language Related Changes

### New: Swift support

Given the full Antlr support, PMD now fully supports Swift. We are pleased to announce we are shipping a number of
rules starting with PMD 7.

* {% rule "swift/errorprone/ForceCast" %} (`swift-errorprone`) flags all force casts, making sure you are
  defensively considering all types. Having the application crash shouldn't be an option.
* {% rule "swift/errorprone/ForceTry" %} (`swift-errorprone`) flags all force tries, making sure you are
  defensively handling exceptions. Having the application crash shouldn't be an option.
* {% rule "swift/bestpractices/ProhibitedInterfaceBuilder" %} (`swift-bestpractices`) flags any usage of interface
  builder. Interface builder files are prone to merge conflicts, and are impossible to code review, so larger
  teams usually try to avoid it or reduce its usage.
* {% rule "swift/bestpractices/UnavailableFunction" %} (`swift-bestpractices`) flags any function throwing
  a `fatalError` not marked as `@available(*, unavailable)` to ensure no calls are actually performed in
  the codebase.

[TomÃ¡s De Lucca](https://github.com/tomidelucca) (@tomidelucca)

### New: Kotlin support (experimental)

PMD now supports Kotlin as an additional language for analyzing source code. It is based on
the official kotlin Antlr grammar. Java-based rules and XPath-based rules are supported.

Kotlin support has **experimental** stability level, meaning no compatibility should
be expected between even incremental releases. Any functionality can be added, removed or changed without
warning.

We are shipping the following rules:

* {% rule kotlin/bestpractices/FunctionNameTooShort %} (`kotlin-bestpractices`) finds functions with a too
  short name.
* {% rule kotlin/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode %} (`kotlin-errorprone`) finds classes with only
  either `equals` or `hashCode` overridden, but not both. This leads to unexpected behavior once instances
  of such classes are used in collections (Lists, HashMaps, ...).

### New: CPD support for TypeScript

Thanks to a contribution, CPD now supports the TypeScript language. It is shipped
with the rest of the JavaScript support in the module `pmd-javascript`.

Contributors: [Paul Guyot](https://github.com/pguyot) (@pguyot)

### New: CPD support for Julia

Thanks to a contribution, CPD now supports the Julia language. It is shipped
in the new module `pmd-julia`.

Contributors: [Wener](https://github.com/wener-tiobe) (@wener-tiobe)

### New: CPD support for Coco

Thanks to a contribution, CPD now supports Coco, a modern programming language
designed specifically for building event-driven software. It is shipped in the new
module `pmd-coco`.

Contributors: [Wener](https://github.com/wener-tiobe) (@wener-tiobe)

### Changed: JavaScript support

The JS specific parser options have been removed. The parser now always retains comments and uses version ES6.
The language module registers a couple of different versions. The latest version, which supports ES6 and also some
new constructs (see [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino)]), is the default. This should be fine for most
use cases.

### Changed: Language versions

We revisited the versions that were defined by each language module. Now many more versions are defined for each
language. In general, you can expect that PMD can parse all these different versions. There might be situations
where this fails and this can be considered a bug. Usually the latest version is selected as the default
language version.

The language versions can be used to mark rules to be useful only for a specific language version via
the `minimumLanguageVersion` and `maximumLanguageVersion` attributes. While this feature is currently only used by
the Java module, listing all possible versions enables other languages as well to use this feature.

Related issue: [[core] Explicitly name all language versions (#4120)](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4120)

### Changed: CPP can now ignore identifiers in sequences (CPD)

* new command line option for CPD: `--ignore-sequences`.
* This option is used for CPP only: with the already existing option `--ignore-literal-sequences`, only
  literals were ignored. The new option additional ignores identifiers as well in sequences.
* See [PR #4470](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4470) for details.

## ðŸŒŸ New and changed rules

### New Rules

**Apex**
* {% rule apex/design/UnusedMethod %} finds unused methods in your code.

**Java**
* {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryBoxing %} reports boxing and unboxing conversions that may be made implicit.

**Kotlin**
* {% rule kotlin/bestpractices/FunctionNameTooShort %}
* {% rule kotlin/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode %}

**Swift**
* {% rule swift/bestpractices/ProhibitedInterfaceBuilder %}
* {% rule swift/bestpractices/UnavailableFunction %}
* {% rule swift/errorprone/ForceCast %}
* {% rule swift/errorprone/ForceTry %}

### Changed Rules

**General changes**

* All statistical rules (like ExcessiveClassLength, ExcessiveParameterList) have been simplified and unified.
  The properties `topscore` and `sigma` have been removed. The property `minimum` is still there, however the type is not
  a decimal number anymore but has been changed to an integer. This affects rules in the languages Apex, Java, PLSQL
  and Velocity Template Language (vm):
    * Apex: {% rule apex/design/ExcessiveClassLength %}, {% rule apex/design/ExcessiveParameterList %},
      {% rule apex/design/ExcessivePublicCount %}, {% rule apex/design/NcssConstructorCount %},
      {% rule apex/design/NcssMethodCount %}, {% rule apex/design/NcssTypeCount %}
    * Java: {% rule java/design/ExcessiveImports %}, {% rule java/design/ExcessiveParameterList %},
      {% rule java/design/ExcessivePublicCount %}, {% rule java/design/SwitchDensity %}
    * PLSQL: {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveMethodLength %}, {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveObjectLength %},
      {% rule plsql/design/ExcessivePackageBodyLength %}, {% rule plsql/design/ExcessivePackageSpecificationLength %},
      {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveParameterList %}, {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveTypeLength %},
      {% rule plsql/design/NcssMethodCount %}, {% rule plsql/design/NcssObjectCount %},
      {% rule plsql/design/NPathComplexity %}
    * VM: {% rule vm/design/ExcessiveTemplateLength %}

* The general property `violationSuppressXPath` which is available for all rules to
  [suppress warnings](pmd_userdocs_suppressing_warnings.html) now uses XPath version 3.1 by default.
  This version of the XPath language is mostly identical to XPath 2.0. In PMD 6, XPath 1.0 has been used.
  If you upgrade from PMD 6, you need to verify your `violationSuppressXPath` properties.

**Apex General changes**

* The properties `cc_categories`, `cc_remediation_points_multiplier`, `cc_block_highlighting` have been removed
  from all rules. These properties have been deprecated since PMD 6.13.0.
  See [issue #1648](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1648) for more details.

**Java General changes**

* Violations reported on methods or classes previously reported the line range of the entire method
  or class. With PMD 7.0.0, the reported location is now just the identifier of the method or class.
  This affects various rules, e.g. {% rule java/design/CognitiveComplexity %}.

  The report location is controlled by the overrides of the method {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node#getReportLocation() %}
  in different node types.

  See [issue #4439](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4439) and [issue #730](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/730)
  for more details.

**Java Best Practices**

* {% rule java/bestpractices/ArrayIsStoredDirectly %}: Violations are now reported on the assignment and not
  anymore on the formal parameter. The reported line numbers will probably move.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/AvoidReassigningLoopVariables %}: This rule might not report anymore all
  reassignments of the control variable in for-loops when the property `forReassign` is set to `skip`.
  See [issue #4500](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4500) for more details.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/LooseCoupling %}: The rule has a new property to allow some types to be coupled
  to (`allowedTypes`).
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnusedLocalVariable %}: This rule has some important false-negatives fixed
  and finds many more cases now. For details see issues [#2130](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2130),
  [#4516](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4516), and [#4517](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4517).

**Java Codestyle**

* {% rule java/codestyle/MethodNamingConventions %}: The property `checkNativeMethods` has been removed. The
  property was deprecated since PMD 6.3.0. Use the property `nativePattern` to control whether native methods
  should be considered or not.
* {% rule java/codestyle/ShortVariable %}: This rule now also reports short enum constant names.
* {% rule java/codestyle/UseDiamondOperator %}: The property `java7Compatibility` has been removed. The rule now
  handles Java 7 properly without a property.
* {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryFullyQualifiedName %}: The rule has two new properties,
  to selectively disable reporting on static field and method qualifiers. The rule also has been improved
  to be more precise.
* {% rule java/codestyle/UselessParentheses %}: The rule has two new properties which control how strict
  the rule should be applied. With `ignoreClarifying` (default: true) parentheses that are strictly speaking
  not necessary are allowed, if they separate expressions of different precedence.
  The other property `ignoreBalancing` (default: true) is similar, in that it allows parentheses that help
  reading and understanding the expressions.

**Java Design**

* {% rule java/design/CyclomaticComplexity %}: The property `reportLevel` has been removed. The property was
  deprecated since PMD 6.0.0. The report level can now be configured separated for classes and methods using
  `classReportLevel` and `methodReportLevel` instead.
* {% rule java/design/ImmutableField %}: The property `ignoredAnnotations` has been removed. The property was
  deprecated since PMD 6.52.0.
* {% rule java/design/LawOfDemeter %}: The rule has a new property `trustRadius`. This defines the maximum degree
  of trusted data. The default of 1 is the most restrictive.
* {% rule java/design/NPathComplexity %}: The property `minimum` has been removed. It was deprecated since PMD 6.0.0.
  Use the property `reportLevel` instead.
* {% rule java/design/SingularField %}: The properties `checkInnerClasses` and `disallowNotAssignment` have been removed.
  The rule is now more precise and will check these cases properly.
* {% rule java/design/UseUtilityClass %}: The property `ignoredAnnotations` has been removed.

**Java Documentation**

* {% rule java/documentation/CommentContent %}: The properties `caseSensitive` and `disallowedTerms` are removed. The
  new property `forbiddenRegex` can be used now to define the disallowed terms with a single regular
  expression.
* {% rule java/documentation/CommentRequired %}:
  * Overridden methods are now detected even without the `@Override`
    annotation. This is relevant for the property `methodWithOverrideCommentRequirement`.
    See also [pull request #3757](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/3757).
  * Elements in annotation types are now detected as well. This might lead to an increased number of violations
    for missing public method comments.
* {% rule java/documentation/CommentSize %}: When determining the line-length of a comment, the leading comment
  prefix markers (e.g. `*` or `//`) are ignored and don't add up to the line-length.
  See also [pull request #4369](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4369).

**Java Error Prone**

* {% rule java/errorprone/AvoidDuplicateLiterals %}: The property `exceptionfile` has been removed. The property was
  deprecated since PMD 6.10.0. Use the property `exceptionList` instead.
* {% rule java/errorprone/DontImportSun %}: `sun.misc.Signal` is not special-cased anymore.
* {% rule java/errorprone/EmptyCatchBlock %}: `CloneNotSupportedException` and `InterruptedException` are not
  special-cased anymore. Rename the exception parameter to `ignored` to ignore them.
* {% rule java/errorprone/ImplicitSwitchFallThrough %}: Violations are now reported on the case statements
  rather than on the switch statements. This is more accurate but might result in more violations now.

### Deprecated Rules

In PMD 7.0.0, there are now deprecated rules.

### Removed Rules

The following previously deprecated rules have been finally removed:

**Apex**

* {% deleted_rule apex/performance/AvoidSoqlInLoops %} -> use {% rule apex/performance/OperationWithLimitsInLoop %}

## ðŸ’¥ Compatibility and Migration Notes

### For endusers

* PMD 7 requires Java 8 or above to execute.
* CLI changed: Custom scripts need to be updated (`run.sh pmd ...` -> `pmd check ...`, `run.sh cpd ...`, `pmd cpd ...`).
* Java module revamped: Custom rules need to be updated.
* Removed rules: Custom rulesets need to be reviewed. See below for a list of new and removed rules.
* XPath 1.0 support is removed, `violationSuppressXPath` now requires XPath 2.0 or 3.1: Custom rulesets need
  to be reviewed.
* Custom rules using rulechains: Need to override {% jdoc core::lang.rule.AbstractRule#buildTargetSelector() %}
  using {% jdoc core::lang.rule.RuleTargetSelector#forTypes(java.lang.Class,java.lang.Class...) %}.
* The asset filenames of PMD on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases) are
  now `pmd-dist-<version>-bin.zip`, `pmd-dist-<version>-src.zip` and `pmd-dist-<version>-doc.zip`.
  Keep that in mind, if you have an automated download script.

  The structure inside the ZIP files stay the same, e.g. we still provide inside the binary distribution
  ZIP file the base directory `pmd-bin-<version>`.

### For integrators

* PMD 7 is a major release where many things have been moved or rewritten.
* All integrators will require some level of change to adapt to the change in the API.
* For more details look at the deprecations notes of the past PMD 6 releases.
* The PMD Ant tasks, which were previously in the module `pmd-core` has been moved into its own module `pmd-ant`
* The CLI classes have also been moved out of `pmd-core` into its own module `pmd-cli`. The old entry point, the
  main class `PMD` is gone.

## ðŸš¨ API

The API of PMD has been growing over the years and needed some cleanup. The goal is, to
have a clear separation between a well-defined API and the implementation, which is internal.
This should help us in future development.

This however entails some incompatibilities and
deprecations, see also the sections [New API support guidelines](#new-api-support-guidelines) and
[API removals](#api-removals) below.

### New API support guidelines

Until now, all released public members and types were implicitly considered part
of PMD's public API, including inheritance-specific members (protected members, abstract methods).
We have maintained those APIs with the goal to preserve full binary compatibility between minor releases,
only breaking those APIs infrequently, for major releases.

In order to allow PMD to move forward at a faster pace, this implicit contract will
be invalidated with PMD 7.0.0. We now introduce more fine-grained distinctions between
the type of compatibility support we guarantee for our libraries, and ways to make
them explicit to clients of PMD.

**`.internal` packages and `@InternalApi` annotation**

*Internal API* is meant for use *only* by the main PMD codebase. Internal types and methods
may be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time.

Any API in a package that contains an `.internal` segment is considered internal.
The `@InternalApi` annotation will be used for APIs that have to live outside of
these packages, e.g. methods of a public type that shouldn't be used outside of PMD (again,
these can be removed anytime).

**`@ReservedSubclassing`**

Types marked with the `@ReservedSubclassing` annotation are only meant to be subclassed
by classes within PMD. As such, we may add new abstract methods, or remove protected methods,
at any time. All published public members remain supported. The annotation is *not* inherited, which
means a reserved interface doesn't prevent its implementors to be subclassed.

**`@Experimental`**

APIs marked with the `@Experimental` annotation at the class or method level are subject to change.
They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. You should not use or rely
on them in any production code. They are purely to allow broad testing and feedback.

**`@Deprecated`**

APIs marked with the `@Deprecated` annotation at the class or method level will remain supported
until the next major release, but it is recommended to stop using them.

### Small Changes and cleanups

* [#1648](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1648): \[apex,vf] Remove CodeClimate dependency - [Robert SÃ¶semann](https://github.com/rsoesemann)
  Properties "cc_categories", "cc_remediation_points_multiplier", "cc_block_highlighting" can no longer be overridden in rulesets.
  They were deprecated without replacement.

* The old GUI applications accessible through `run.sh designerold` and `run.sh bgastviewer`
  (and corresponding Batch scripts) have been removed from the PMD distribution. Please use the newer rule designer
  with `pmd designer`. The corresponding classes in packages `java.net.sourceforge.pmd.util.viewer` and
  `java.net.sourceforge.pmd.util.designer` have all been removed.

* All API related to XPath support has been moved to the package {% jdoc_package core::lang.rule.xpath %}.
  This includes API that was previously dispersed over `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang`, `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.ast.xpath`,
  `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.xpath`, `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule`, and various language-specific packages
  (which were made internal).

* The implementation of the Ant integration has been moved from the module `pmd-core` to a new module `pmd-ant`.
  This involves classes in package {% jdoc_package ant::ant %}. The ant CPDTask class `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPDTask`
  has been moved into the same package {% jdoc_package ant::ant %}. You'll need to update your taskdef entries in your
  build.xml files with the FQCN {% jdoc !!ant::ant.CPDTask %} if you use it anywhere.

* Utility classes in {% jdoc_package core::util %}, that have previously marked as `@InternalApi` have been finally
  moved to {% jdoc_package core::internal.util %}. This includes ClasspathClassLoader, FileFinder, FileUtil, and
  IOUtil.

* The following utility classes in {% jdoc_package core::util %} are now considered public API:
  * {% jdoc core::util.AssertionUtil %}
  * {% jdoc core::util.CollectionUtil %}
  * {% jdoc core::util.ContextedAssertionError %}
  * {% jdoc core::util.ContextedStackOverflowError %}
  * {% jdoc core::util.GraphUtil %}
  * {% jdoc core::util.IteratorUtil %}
  * {% jdoc core::util.StringUtil %}

* Moved the two classes {% jdoc core::cpd.impl.AntlrTokenizer %} and {% jdoc core::cpd.impl.JavaCCTokenizer %} from
  `internal` package into package {% jdoc_package core::cpd.impl %}. These two classes are part of the API and
  are base classes for CPD language implementations. Since 7.0.0-rc2.
* `AntlrBaseRule` is gone in favor of {% jdoc core::lang.rule.AbstractVisitorRule %}. Since 7.0.0-rc2.
* The classes {% jdoc kotlin::lang.kotlin.ast.KotlinInnerNode %} and {% jdoc swift::lang.swift.ast.SwiftInnerNode %}
  are package-private now. Since 7.0.0-rc2.

### XPath 3.1 support

Support for XPath versions 1.0, 1.0-compatibility was removed, support for XPath 2.0 is deprecated. The default
(and only) supported XPath version is now XPath 3.1. This version of the XPath language is mostly identical to
XPath 2.0.

Notable changes:
* The deprecated support for sequence-valued attributes is removed. Sequence-valued properties are still supported.
* Refer to [the Saxonica documentation](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/expressions/xpath31new.html) for
  an introduction to new features in XPath 3.1.

### Node stream API for AST traversal

This version includes a powerful API to navigate trees, similar in usage to the Java 8 Stream API:
```java
node.descendants(ASTMethodCall.class)
    .filter(m -> "toString".equals(m.getMethodName()))
    .map(m -> m.getQualifier())
    .filter(q -> TypeTestUtil.isA(String.class, q))
    .foreach(System.out::println);
```

A pipeline like shown here traverses the tree lazily, which is more efficient than traversing eagerly to put all
descendants in a list. It is also much easier to change than the old imperative way.

To make this API as accessible as possible, the {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %} interface has been fitted with new
methods producing node streams. Those methods replace previous tree traversal methods like `Node#findDescendantsOfType`.
In all cases, they should be more efficient and more convenient.

See {% jdoc core::lang.ast.NodeStream %} for more details.

### Metrics framework

The metrics framework has been made simpler and more general.

* The metric interface takes an additional type parameter, representing the result type of the metric. This is
  usually `Integer` or `Double`. It avoids widening the result to a `double` just to narrow it down.

  This makes it so, that `Double.NaN` is not an appropriate sentinel value to represent "not supported" anymore.
  Instead, `computeFor` may return `null` in that case (or a garbage value). The value `null` may have caused
  problems with the narrowing casts, which through unboxing, might have thrown an NPE. But when we deprecated
  the language-specific metrics faÃ§ades to replace them with the generic `MetricsUtil`, we took care of making
  the new methods throw an exception if the metric cannot be computed on the parameter. This forces you to guard
  calls to `MetricsUtil::computeMetric` with something like `if (metric.supports(node))`. If you're following
  this pattern, then you won't observe the undefined behavior.

* The `MetricKey` interface is not so useful and has been merged into the `Metric` interface and removed. So
  the `Metric` interface has the new method `String name()`.

* The framework is not tied to at most 2 node types per language anymore. Previously those were nodes for
  classes and for methods/constructors. Instead, many metrics support more node types. For example, NCSS can
  be computed on any code block.

  For that reason, keeping around a hard distinction between "class metrics" and "operation metrics" is not
  useful. So in the Java framework for example, we removed the interfaces `JavaClassMetric`, `JavaOperationMetric`,
  abstract classes for those, `JavaClassMetricKey`, and `JavaOperationMetricKey`. Metric constants are now all
  inside the `JavaMetrics` utility class. The same was done in the Apex framework.

  We don't really need abstract classes for metrics now. So `AbstractMetric` is also removed from pmd-core.
  There is a factory method on the `Metric` interface to create a metric easily.

* This makes it so, that {% jdoc core::lang.metrics.LanguageMetricsProvider %} does not need type parameters.
  It can just return a `Set<Metric<?, ?>>` to list available metrics.

* {% jdoc_old core::lang.metrics.Signature %}s, their implementations, and the interface `SignedNode` have been
  removed. Node streams allow replacing their usages very easily.

### Testing framework

* PMD 7 has been upgraded to use JUnit 5 only. That means, that JUnit4 related classes have been removed, namely
  * `net.sourceforge.pmd.testframework.PMDTestRunner`
  * `net.sourceforge.pmd.testframework.RuleTestRunner`
  * `net.sourceforge.pmd.testframework.TestDescriptor`
* Rule tests, that use {% jdoc test::testframework.SimpleAggregatorTst %} or
  {% jdoc test::testframework.PmdRuleTst %} work as before without change, but use
  now JUnit5 under the hood. If you added additional JUnit4 tests to your rule test classes, then you'll
  need to upgrade them to use JUnit5.

### Language Lifecycle and Language Properties

* Language modules now provide a proper lifecycle and can store global information. This enables the implementation
  of multifile analysis.
* Language modules can define [custom language properties](pmd_languages_configuration.html)
  which can be set via environment variables. This allows to add and use language specific configuration options
  without the need to change pmd-core.

The documentation page has been updated:
[Adding a new language with JavaCC](pmd_devdocs_major_adding_new_language_javacc.html)
and [Adding a new language with ANTLR](pmd_devdocs_major_adding_new_language_antlr.html)

Related issue: [[core] Language lifecycle (#3782)](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3782)


### API changes

#### 7.0.0-rc3

* The following previously deprecated classes have been removed:
  * pmd-core
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.PMD`
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.PMDCommandLineInterface`
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.PMDParameters`
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.PmdParametersParseResult`
* The asset filenames of PMD on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases) are
  now `pmd-dist-<version>-bin.zip`, `pmd-dist-<version>-src.zip` and `pmd-dist-<version>-doc.zip`.
  Keep that in mind, if you have an automated download script.

  The structure inside the ZIP files stay the same, e.g. we still provide inside the binary distribution
  ZIP file the base directory `pmd-bin-<version>`.
* The CLI option `--stress` (or `-stress`) has been removed without replacement.
* The CLI option `--minimum-priority` was changed with 7.0.0-rc1 to only take the following values:
  High, Medium High, Medium, Medium Low, Low. With 7.0.0-rc2 compatibility has been restored, so that the equivalent
  integer values (1 to 5) are supported as well.
* Replaced `RuleViolation::getFilename` with new {% jdoc !!core::RuleViolation#getFileId() %}, that returns a
  {% jdoc core::lang.document.FileId %}. This is an identifier for a {% jdoc core::lang.document.TextFile %}
  and could represent a path name. This allows to have a separate display name, e.g. renderers use
  {% jdoc core::reporting.FileNameRenderer %} to either display the full path name or a relative path name
  (see {% jdoc !!core::renderers.Renderer#setFileNameRenderer(net.sourceforge.pmd.reporting.FileNameRenderer) %} and
  {%jdoc core::reporting.ConfigurableFileNameRenderer %}). Many places where we used a simple String for
  a path-like name before have been adapted to use the new {% jdoc core::lang.document.FileId %}.

  See [PR #4425](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4425) for details.

#### 7.0.0-rc2

* The following previously deprecated classes have been removed:
  * pmd-core 
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.PMD`
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.PMDCommandLineInterface`
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.PMDParameters`
    * `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.PmdParametersParseResult`

* The CLI option `--minimum-priority` was changed with 7.0.0-rc1 to only take the following values:
  High, Medium High, Medium, Medium Low, Low. With 7.0.0-rc2 compatibility has been restored, so that the equivalent
  integer values (1 to 5) are supported as well.

#### 7.0.0-rc1

* The CLI option `--stress` (or `-stress`) has been removed without replacement.
* The CLI option `--minimum-priority` now takes one of the following values instead of an integer:
  High, Medium High, Medium, Medium Low, Low.

#### 6.55.0

**Go**

* The LanguageModule of Go, that only supports CPD execution, has been deprecated. This language
  is not fully supported by PMD, so having a language module does not make sense. The functionality of CPD is
  not affected by this change. The following class has been deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0:
  * {% jdoc go::lang.go.GoLanguageModule %}

**Java**
* Support for Java 18 preview language features have been removed. The version "18-preview" is no longer available.
* The experimental class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast.ASTGuardedPattern` has been removed.

#### 6.54.0

**PMD CLI**

* PMD now supports a new `--relativize-paths-with` flag (or short `-z`), which replaces `--short-names`.
  It serves the same purpose: Shortening the pathnames in the reports. However, with the new flag it's possible
  to explicitly define one or more pathnames that should be used as the base when creating relative paths.
  The old flag `--short-names` is deprecated.

**Deprecated APIs**

**For removal**

* {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ApexRootNode#getApexVersion() %} has been deprecated for removal. The version returned is
  always `Version.CURRENT`, as the apex compiler integration doesn't use additional information which Apex version
  actually is used. Therefore, this method can't be used to determine the Apex version of the project
  that is being analyzed.
* {% jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#setEncoding(java.lang.String) %} and
  {% jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#getEncoding() %}. Use the methods
  {% jdoc core::AbstractConfiguration#getSourceEncoding() %} and
  {% jdoc core::AbstractConfiguration#setSourceEncoding(java.lang.String) %} instead. Both are available
  for `CPDConfiguration` which extends `AbstractConfiguration`.
* {% jdoc test::cli.BaseCLITest %} and {% jdoc test::cli.BaseCPDCLITest %} have been deprecated for removal without
  replacement. CLI tests should be done in pmd-core only (and in PMD7 in pmd-cli). Individual language modules
  shouldn't need to test the CLI integration logic again. Instead, the individual language modules should test their
  functionality as unit tests.
* {% jdoc core::cpd.CPDConfiguration.LanguageConverter %}

* {% jdoc !!core::lang.document.FileCollector#addZipFile(java.nio.file.Path) %} has been deprecated. It is replaced
  by {% jdoc !!core::lang.document.FileCollector#addZipFileWithContent(java.nio.file.Path) %} which directly adds the
  content of the zip file for analysis.

* {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setReportShortNames(boolean) %} and
  {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#isReportShortNames() %} have been deprecated for removal.
  Use {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#addRelativizeRoot(java.nio.file.Path) %} instead.

**Internal APIs**

* {% jdoc core::renderers.CSVWriter %}
* Some fields in {% jdoc test::ant.AbstractAntTestHelper %}

**Experimental APIs**

* CPDReport has a new method which limited mutation of a given report:
  * {%jdoc core::cpd.CPDReport#filterMatches(net.sourceforge.pmd.util.Predicate) %} creates a new CPD report
    with some matches removed with a given predicate based filter.

#### 6.53.0

**Deprecated APIs**

**For removal**

These classes / APIs have been deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.

* {% jdoc java::lang.java.rule.design.ExcessiveLengthRule %} (Java)

#### 6.52.0

**PMD CLI**

* PMD now supports a new `--use-version` flag, which receives a language-version pair (such as `java-8` or `apex-54`).
  This supersedes the usage of `-language` / `-l` and `-version` / `-v`, allowing for multiple versions to be set in a single run.
  PMD 7 will completely remove support for `-language` and `-version` in favor of this new flag.

* Support for `-V` is being deprecated in favor of `--verbose` in preparation for PMD 7.
  In PMD 7, `-v` will enable verbose mode and `-V` will show the PMD version for consistency with most Unix/Linux tools.

* Support for `-min` is being deprecated in favor of `--minimum-priority` for consistency with most Unix/Linux tools, where `-min` would be equivalent to `-m -i -n`.

**CPD CLI**

* CPD now supports using `-d` or `--dir` as an alias to `--files`, in favor of consistency with PMD.
  PMD 7 will remove support for `--files` in favor of these new flags.

**Linux run.sh parameters**

* Using `run.sh cpdgui` will now warn about it being deprecated. Use `run.sh cpd-gui` instead.

* The old designer (`run.sh designerold`) is completely deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7. Switch to the new JavaFX designer: `run.sh designer`.

* The old visual AST viewer (`run.sh bgastviewer`) is completely deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7. Switch to the new JavaFX designer: `run.sh designer` for a visual tool, or use `run.sh ast-dump` for a text-based alternative.

**Deprecated API**

* The following core APIs have been marked as deprecated for removal in PMD 7:
  - {% jdoc core::PMD %} and {% jdoc core::PMD.StatusCode %} - PMD 7 will ship with a revamped CLI split from pmd-core. To programmatically launch analysis you can use {% jdoc core::PmdAnalysis %}.
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getAllInputPaths() %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getInputPathList() %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setInputPaths(List) %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setInputPathList(List) %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#addInputPath(String) %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#addInputPath(Path) %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getInputFilePath() %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getInputFile() %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getIgnoreFilePath() %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getIgnoreFile() %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setInputFilePath(String) %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setInputFilePath(Path) %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setIgnoreFilePath(String) %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setIgnoreFilePath(Path) %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getInputUri() %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getUri() %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setInputUri(String) %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setInputUri(URI) %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getReportFile() %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#getReportFilePath() %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setReportFile(String) %} - It is now superseded by {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setReportFile(Path) %}
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#isStressTest() %} and {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setStressTest(boolean) %} - Will be removed with no replacement.
  - {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#isBenchmark() %} and {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setBenchmark(boolean) %} - Will be removed with no replacement, the CLI will still support it.
  - {% jdoc core::cpd.CPD %} and {% jdoc core::cpd.CPD.StatusCode %} - PMD 7 will ship with a revamped CLI split from pmd-core. An alterative to programatically launch CPD analysis will be added in due time.

* In order to reduce the dependency on Apex Jorje classes, the method {% jdoc !!visualforce::lang.vf.DataType#fromBasicType(apex.jorje.semantic.symbol.type.BasicType) %}
  has been deprecated. The equivalent method {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.DataType#fromTypeName(java.lang.String) %} should be used instead.

#### 6.51.0

No changes.

#### 6.50.0

**CPD CLI**

* CPD now supports the `--ignore-literal-sequences` argument when analyzing Lua code.

#### 6.49.0

**Deprecated API**

* In order to reduce the dependency on Apex Jorje classes, the following methods have been deprecated.
  These methods all leaked internal Jorje enums. These enums have been replaced now by enums the
  PMD's AST package.
  * {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTAssignmentExpression#getOperator() %}
  * {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTBinaryExpression#getOperator() %}
  * {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTBooleanExpression#getOperator() %}
  * {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTPostfixExpression#getOperator() %}
  * {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTPrefixExpression#getOperator() %}

  All these classes have now a new `getOp()` method. Existing code should be refactored to use this method instead.
  It returns the new enums, like {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.AssignmentOperator %}, and avoids
  the dependency to Jorje.

#### 6.48.0

**CPD CLI**

* CPD has a new CLI option `--debug`. This option has the same behavior as in PMD. It enables more verbose
  logging output.

**Rule Test Framework**

* The module "pmd-test", which contains support classes to write rule tests, now **requires Java 8**. If you depend on
  this module for testing your own custom rules, you'll need to make sure to use at least Java 8.
* The new module "pmd-test-schema" contains now the XSD schema and the code to parse the rule test XML files. The
  schema has been extracted in order to easily share it with other tools like the Rule Designer or IDE plugins.
* Test schema changes:
  * The attribute `isRegressionTest` of `test-code` is deprecated. The new
    attribute `disabled` should be used instead for defining whether a rule test should be skipped or not.
  * The attributes `reinitializeRule` and `useAuxClasspath` of `test-code` are deprecated and assumed true.
    They will not be replaced.
  * The new attribute `focused` of `test-code` allows disabling all tests except the focused one temporarily.
* More information about the rule test framework can be found in the documentation:
  [Testing your rules](pmd_userdocs_extending_testing.html)

**Deprecated API**

* The experimental Java AST class {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTGuardedPattern %} has been deprecated and
  will be removed. It was introduced for Java 17 and Java 18 Preview as part of pattern matching for switch,
  but it is no longer supported with Java 19 Preview.
* The interface {% jdoc core::cpd.renderer.CPDRenderer %} is deprecated. For custom CPD renderers
  the new interface {% jdoc core::cpd.renderer.CPDReportRenderer %} should be used.
* The class {% jdoc test::testframework.TestDescriptor %} is deprecated, replaced with {% jdoc test-schema::test.schema.RuleTestDescriptor %}.
* Many methods of {% jdoc test::testframework.RuleTst %} have been deprecated as internal API.

**Experimental APIs**

* To support the Java preview language features "Pattern Matching for Switch" and "Record Patterns", the following
  AST nodes have been introduced as experimental:
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTSwitchGuard %}
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTRecordPattern %}
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTComponentPatternList %}

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

* {%jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#setRenderer(net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Renderer) %}
* {%jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#setCPDRenderer(net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.renderer.CPDRenderer) %}
* {%jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#getRenderer() %}
* {%jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#getCPDRenderer() %}
* {%jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#getRendererFromString(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) %}
* {%jdoc !!core::cpd.CPDConfiguration#getCPDRendererFromString(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) %}
* {%jdoc core::cpd.renderer.CPDRendererAdapter %}

#### 6.47.0

No changes.

#### 6.46.0

**Deprecated ruleset references**

Ruleset references with the following formats are now deprecated and will produce a warning
when used on the CLI or in a ruleset XML file:
- `<lang-name>-<ruleset-name>`, eg `java-basic`, which resolves to `rulesets/java/basic.xml`
- the internal release number, eg `600`, which resolves to `rulesets/releases/600.xml`

Use the explicit forms of these references to be compatible with PMD 7.

**Deprecated API**

- {% jdoc core::RuleSetReferenceId#toString() %} is now deprecated. The format of this
  method will remain the same until PMD 7. The deprecation is intended to steer users
  away from relying on this format, as it may be changed in PMD 7.
- {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#getInputPaths() %} and
  {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#setInputPaths(java.lang.String) %} are now deprecated.
  A new set of methods have been added, which use lists and do not rely on comma splitting.

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

- {% jdoc core::cpd.CPDCommandLineInterface %} has been internalized. In order to execute CPD either
  {% jdoc !!core::cpd.CPD#run(java.lang.String...) %} or {% jdoc !!core::cpd.CPD#main(java.lang.String[]) %}
  should be used.
- Several members of {% jdoc test::cli.BaseCPDCLITest %} have been deprecated with replacements.
- The methods {% jdoc !!core::ant.Formatter#start(java.lang.String) %},
  {% jdoc !!core::ant.Formatter#end(net.sourceforge.pmd.Report) %}, {% jdoc !!core::ant.Formatter#getRenderer() %},
  and {% jdoc !!core::ant.Formatter#isNoOutputSupplied() %} have been internalized.

#### 6.45.0

**Experimental APIs**

* Report has two new methods which allow limited mutations of a given report:
  * {% jdoc !!core::Report#filterViolations(net.sourceforge.pmd.util.Predicate) %} creates a new report with
    some violations removed with a given predicate based filter.
  * {% jdoc !!core::Report#union(net.sourceforge.pmd.Report) %} can combine two reports into a single new Report.
* {% jdoc !!core::util.Predicate %} will be replaced in PMD7 with the standard Predicate interface from java8.
* The module `pmd-html` is entirely experimental right now. Anything in the package
  `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.html` should be used cautiously.

#### 6.44.0

**Deprecated API**

* Several members of {% jdoc core::PMD %} have been newly deprecated, including:
  - `PMD#EOL`: use `System#lineSeparator()`
  - `PMD#SUPPRESS_MARKER`: use {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#DEFAULT_SUPPRESS_MARKER %}
  - `PMD#processFiles`: use the new programmatic API
  - `PMD#getApplicableFiles`: is internal
* {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#prependClasspath(java.lang.String) %} is deprecated
  in favour of {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#prependAuxClasspath(java.lang.String) %}.
* {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setRuleSets(java.lang.String) %} and
  {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#getRuleSets() %} are deprecated. Use instead
  {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#setRuleSets(java.util.List) %},
  {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#addRuleSet(java.lang.String) %},
  and {% jdoc core::PMDConfiguration#getRuleSetPaths() %}.
* Several members of {% jdoc test::cli.BaseCLITest %} have been deprecated with replacements.
* Several members of {% jdoc core::cli.PMDCommandLineInterface %} have been explicitly deprecated.
  The whole class however was deprecated long ago already with 6.30.0. It is internal API and should
  not be used.

* In modelica, the rule classes {% jdoc modelica::lang.modelica.rule.AmbiguousResolutionRule %}
  and {% jdoc modelica::lang.modelica.rule.ConnectUsingNonConnector %} have been deprecated,
  since they didn't comply to the usual rule class naming conventions yet.
  The replacements are in the subpackage `bestpractices`.

**Experimental APIs**

*   Together with the new programmatic API the interface
    {% jdoc core::lang.document.TextFile %} has been added as *experimental*. It intends
    to replace {% jdoc core::util.datasource.DataSource %} and {% jdoc core::cpd.SourceCode %} in the long term.

    This interface will change in PMD 7 to support read/write operations
    and other things. You don't need to use it in PMD 6, as {% jdoc core::lang.document.FileCollector %}
    decouples you from this. A file collector is available through {% jdoc !!core::PmdAnalysis#files() %}.

#### 6.43.0

**Deprecated API**

Some API deprecations were performed in core PMD classes, to improve compatibility with PMD 7.
- {% jdoc core::Report %}: the constructor and other construction methods like addViolation or createReport
- {% jdoc core::RuleContext %}: all constructors, getters and setters. A new set
  of stable methods, matching those in PMD 7, was added to replace the `addViolation`
  overloads of {% jdoc core::lang.rule.AbstractRule %}. In PMD 7, `RuleContext` will
  be the API to report violations, and it can already be used as such in PMD 6.
- The field {% jdoc core::PMD#configuration %} is unused and will be removed.

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

- {% jdoc core::RuleSet %}: methods that serve to apply rules, including `apply`, `start`, `end`, `removeDysfunctionalRules`
- {% jdoc !!core::renderers.AbstractAccumulatingRenderer#renderFileReport(Report) %} is internal API
  and should not be overridden in own renderers.

**Changed API**

It is now forbidden to report a violation:
- With a `null` node
- With a `null` message
- With a `null` set of format arguments (prefer a zero-length array)

Note that the message is set from the XML rule declaration, so this is only relevant
if you instantiate rules manually.

{% jdoc core::RuleContext %} now requires setting the current rule before calling
{% jdoc core::Rule#apply(java.util.List, core::RuleContext) %}. This is
done automatically by `RuleSet#apply` and such. Creating and configuring a
`RuleContext` manually is strongly advised against, as the lifecycle of `RuleContext`
will change drastically in PMD 7.

#### 6.42.0

No changes.

#### 6.41.0

**Command Line Interface**

The command line options for PMD and CPD now use GNU-syle long options format. E.g. instead of `-rulesets` the
preferred usage is now `--rulesets`. Alternatively one can still use the short option `-R`.
Some options also have been renamed to a more consistent casing pattern at the same time
(`--fail-on-violation` instead of `-failOnViolation`).
The old single-dash options are still supported but are deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.
This change makes the command line interface more consistent within PMD and also less surprising
compared to other cli tools.

The changes in detail for PMD:

|old option                     |new option|
|-------------------------------|----------|
| `-rulesets`                   | `--rulesets` (or `-R`) |
| `-uri`                        | `--uri` |

| `-ignorelist`                 | `--ignore-list` |
| `-format`                     | `--format` (or `-f`) |
| `-debug`                      | `--debug` |
| `-verbose`                    | `--verbose` |
| `-help`                       | `--help` |
| `-encoding`                   | `--encoding` |

| `-showsuppressed`             | `--show-suppressed` |
| `-suppressmarker`             | `--suppress-marker` |
| `-minimumpriority`            | `--minimum-priority` |

| `--failOnViolation`           | `--fail-on-violation` |
| `-norulesetcompatibility`     | `--no-ruleset-compatibility` |
| `-cache`                      | `--cache` |
| `-no-cache`                   | `--no-cache` |

The changes in detail for CPD:

|old option             |new option|
|-----------------------|----------|
| `--failOnViolation`   | `--fail-on-violation` |
| `-failOnViolation`    | `--fail-on-violation` |
| `--filelist`          | `--file-list` |

#### 6.40.0

**Experimental APIs**

*   The interface {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTCommentContainer %} has been added to the Apex AST.
    It provides a way to check whether a node contains at least one comment. Currently this is only implemented for
    {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.ASTCatchBlockStatement %} and used by the rule
    {% rule apex/errorprone/EmptyCatchBlock %}.
    This information is also available via XPath attribute `@ContainsComment`.

#### 6.39.0

No changes.

#### 6.38.0

No changes.

#### 6.37.0

**PMD CLI**

*   PMD has a new CLI option `-force-language`. With that a language can be forced to be used for all input files,
    irrespective of filenames. When using this option, the automatic language selection by extension is disabled
    and all files are tried to be parsed with the given language. Parsing errors are ignored and unparsable files
    are skipped.

    This option allows to use the xml language for files, that don't use xml as extension.
    See also the examples on [PMD CLI reference](pmd_userdocs_cli_reference.html#analyze-other-xml-formats).

**Experimental APIs**

*   The AST types and APIs around Sealed Classes are not experimental anymore:
  *   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#isSealed() %},
      {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#isNonSealed() %},
      {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#getPermittedSubclasses() %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTPermitsList %}

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   The inner class {% jdoc !!core::cpd.TokenEntry.State %} is considered to be internal API.
    It will probably be moved away with PMD 7.

#### 6.36.0

No changes.

#### 6.35.0

**Deprecated API**

*   {% jdoc !!core::PMD#doPMD(net.sourceforge.pmd.PMDConfiguration) %} is deprecated.
    Use {% jdoc !!core::PMD#runPMD(net.sourceforge.pmd.PMDConfiguration) %} instead.
*   {% jdoc !!core::PMD#run(java.lang.String[]) %} is deprecated.
    Use {% jdoc !!core::PMD#runPMD(java.lang.String...) %} instead.
*   {% jdoc core::ThreadSafeReportListener %} and the methods to use them in {% jdoc core::Report %}
    ({% jdoc core::Report#addListener(net.sourceforge.pmd.ThreadSafeReportListener) %},
    {% jdoc core::Report#getListeners() %}, {% jdoc core::Report#addListeners(java.util.List) %})
    are deprecated. This functionality will be replaced by another TBD mechanism in PMD 7.

#### 6.34.0

No changes.

#### 6.33.0

No changes.

#### 6.32.0

**Experimental APIs**

*   The experimental class `ASTTypeTestPattern` has been renamed to {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTTypePattern %}
    in order to align the naming to the JLS.
*   The experimental class `ASTRecordConstructorDeclaration` has been renamed to {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTCompactConstructorDeclaration %}
    in order to align the naming to the JLS.
*   The AST types and APIs around Pattern Matching and Records are not experimental anymore:
  *   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTVariableDeclaratorId#isPatternBinding() %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTPattern %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTTypePattern %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTRecordDeclaration %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTRecordComponentList %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTRecordComponent %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTRecordBody %}
  *   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTCompactConstructorDeclaration %}

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   The protected or public member of the Java rule {% jdoc java::lang.java.rule.bestpractices.AvoidUsingHardCodedIPRule %}
    are deprecated and considered to be internal API. They will be removed with PMD 7.

#### 6.31.0

**Deprecated API**

*   {% jdoc xml::lang.xml.rule.AbstractDomXmlRule %}
*   {% jdoc xml::lang.wsdl.rule.AbstractWsdlRule %}
*   A few methods of {% jdoc xml::lang.xml.rule.AbstractXmlRule %}

**Experimental APIs**

*   The method {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.GenericToken#getKind() %} has been added as experimental. This
    unifies the token interface for both JavaCC and Antlr. The already existing method
    {% jdoc !!core::cpd.token.AntlrToken#getKind() %} is therefore experimental as well. The
    returned constant depends on the actual language and might change whenever the grammar
    of the language is changed.

#### 6.30.0

**Deprecated API**

**Around RuleSet parsing**

* {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactory %} and {% jdoc core::RulesetsFactoryUtils %} have been deprecated in favor of {% jdoc core::RuleSetLoader %}. This is easier to configure, and more maintainable than the multiple overloads of `RulesetsFactoryUtils`.
* Some static creation methods have been added to {% jdoc core::RuleSet %} for simple cases, eg {% jdoc core::RuleSet#forSingleRule(core::Rule) %}. These replace some counterparts in {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactory %}
* Since {% jdoc core::RuleSets %} is also deprecated, many APIs that require a RuleSets instance now are deprecated, and have a counterpart that expects a `List<RuleSet>`.
* {% jdoc core::RuleSetReferenceId %}, {% jdoc core::RuleSetReference %}, {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactoryCompatibility %} are deprecated. They are most likely not relevant outside of the implementation of pmd-core.

**Around the `PMD` class**

Many classes around PMD's entry point ({% jdoc core::PMD %}) have been deprecated as internal, including:
* The contents of the packages {% jdoc_package core::cli %}, {% jdoc_package core::processor %}
* {% jdoc core::SourceCodeProcessor %}
* The constructors of {% jdoc core::PMD %} (the class will be made a utility class)

**Miscellaneous**

*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTPackageDeclaration#getPackageNameImage() %},
    {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTTypeParameter#getParameterName() %}
    and the corresponding XPath attributes. In both cases they're replaced with a new method `getName`,
    the attribute is `@Name`.
*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTClassOrInterfaceBody#isAnonymousInnerClass() %},
    and {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTClassOrInterfaceBody#isEnumChild() %},
    refs [#905](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/905)

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   {% jdoc !!javascript::lang.ecmascript.Ecmascript3Handler %}
*   {% jdoc !!javascript::lang.ecmascript.Ecmascript3Parser %}
*   {% jdoc !!javascript::lang.ecmascript.ast.EcmascriptParser#parserOptions %}
*   {% jdoc !!javascript::lang.ecmascript.ast.EcmascriptParser#getSuppressMap() %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.rule.ParametricRuleViolation %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.ParserOptions#suppressMarker %}
*   {% jdoc !!modelica::lang.modelica.rule.ModelicaRuleViolationFactory %}

#### 6.29.0

No changes.

#### 6.28.0

**Deprecated API**

**For removal**

* {% jdoc !!core::RuleViolationComparator %}. Use {% jdoc !!core::RuleViolation#DEFAULT_COMPARATOR %} instead.
* {% jdoc !!core::cpd.AbstractTokenizer %}. Use {% jdoc !!core::cpd.AnyTokenizer %} instead.
* {% jdoc !!fortran::cpd.FortranTokenizer %}. Was replaced by an {% jdoc core::cpd.AnyTokenizer %}. Use {% jdoc !!fortran::cpd.FortranLanguage#getTokenizer() %} anyway.
* {% jdoc !!perl::cpd.PerlTokenizer %}. Was replaced by an {% jdoc core::cpd.AnyTokenizer %}. Use {% jdoc !!perl::cpd.PerlLanguage#getTokenizer() %} anyway.
* {% jdoc !!ruby::cpd.RubyTokenizer %}. Was replaced by an {% jdoc core::cpd.AnyTokenizer %}. Use {% jdoc !!ruby::cpd.RubyLanguage#getTokenizer() %} anyway.
* {% jdoc !!core::lang.rule.RuleReference#getOverriddenLanguage() %} and
  {% jdoc !!core::lang.rule.RuleReference#setLanguage(net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.Language) %}
* Antlr4 generated lexers:
  * {% jdoc !!cs::lang.cs.antlr4.CSharpLexer %} will be moved to package `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.cs.ast` with PMD 7.
  * {% jdoc !!dart::lang.dart.antlr4.Dart2Lexer %} will be renamed to `DartLexer` and moved to package
    `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dart.ast` with PMD 7. All other classes in the old package will be removed.
  * {% jdoc !!go::lang.go.antlr4.GolangLexer %} will be moved to package
    `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.go.ast` with PMD 7. All other classes in the old package will be removed.
  * {% jdoc !!kotlin::lang.kotlin.antlr4.Kotlin %} will be renamed to `KotlinLexer` and moved to package
    `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.kotlin.ast` with PMD 7.
  * {% jdoc !!lua::lang.lua.antlr4.LuaLexer %} will be moved to package
    `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.lua.ast` with PMD 7. All other classes in the old package will be removed.

#### 6.27.0

*   XML rule definition in rulesets: In PMD 7, the `language` attribute will be required on all `rule`
    elements that declare a new rule. Some base rule classes set the language implicitly in their
    constructor, and so this is not required in all cases for the rule to work. But this
    behavior will be discontinued in PMD 7, so missing `language` attributes are now
    reported as a forward compatibility warning.

**Deprecated API**

**For removal**

*   {% jdoc !!core::Rule#getParserOptions() %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.Parser#getParserOptions() %}
*   {% jdoc core::lang.AbstractParser %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::RuleContext#removeAttribute(java.lang.String) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::RuleContext#getAttribute(java.lang.String) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::RuleContext#setAttribute(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object) %}
*   {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ApexParserOptions %}
*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTThrowStatement#getFirstClassOrInterfaceTypeImage() %}
*   {% jdoc javascript::lang.ecmascript.EcmascriptParserOptions %}
*   {% jdoc javascript::lang.ecmascript.rule.EcmascriptXPathRule %}
*   {% jdoc xml::lang.xml.XmlParserOptions %}
*   {% jdoc xml::lang.xml.rule.XmlXPathRule %}
*   Properties of {% jdoc xml::lang.xml.rule.AbstractXmlRule %}

*   {% jdoc !!core::Report.ReadableDuration %}
*   Many methods of {% jdoc !!core::Report %}. They are replaced by accessors
    that produce a List. For example, {% jdoc !a!core::Report#iterator() %}
    (and implementing Iterable) and {% jdoc !a!core::Report#isEmpty() %} are both
    replaced by {% jdoc !a!core::Report#getViolations() %}.

*   The dataflow codebase is deprecated for removal in PMD 7. This
    includes all code in the following packages, and their subpackages:
  *   {% jdoc_package plsql::lang.plsql.dfa %}
  *   {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.dfa %}
  *   {% jdoc_package core::lang.dfa %}
  *   and the class {% jdoc plsql::lang.plsql.PLSQLDataFlowHandler %}

*   {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfSimpleCharStream %}

*   {% jdoc jsp::lang.jsp.ast.ASTJspDeclarations %}
*   {% jdoc jsp::lang.jsp.ast.ASTJspDocument %}
*   {% jdoc !!scala::lang.scala.ast.ScalaParserVisitorAdapter#zero() %}
*   {% jdoc !!scala::lang.scala.ast.ScalaParserVisitorAdapter#combine(Object, Object) %}
*   {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.ApexParserVisitorReducedAdapter %}
*   {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.JavaParserVisitorReducedAdapter %}

* {% jdoc java::lang.java.typeresolution.TypeHelper %} is deprecated in
  favor of {% jdoc java::lang.java.types.TypeTestUtil %}, which has the
  same functionality, but a slightly changed API.
* Many of the classes in {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.symboltable %}
  are deprecated as internal API.

#### 6.26.0

**Deprecated API**

**For removal**

* {% jdoc core::lang.rule.RuleChainVisitor %} and all implementations in language modules
* {% jdoc core::lang.rule.AbstractRuleChainVisitor %}
* {% jdoc !!core::lang.Language#getRuleChainVisitorClass() %}
* {% jdoc !!core::lang.BaseLanguageModule#<init>(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class,java.lang.String...) %}
* {% jdoc core::lang.rule.ImportWrapper %}

#### 6.25.0

*   The maven module `net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-scala` is deprecated. Use `net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-scala_2.13`
    or `net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-scala_2.12` instead.

*   Rule implementation classes are internal API and should not be used by clients directly.
    The rules should only be referenced via their entry in the corresponding category ruleset
    (e.g. `<rule ref="category/java/bestpractices.xml/AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod" />`).

    While we definitely won't move or rename the rule classes in PMD 6.x, we might consider changes
    in PMD 7.0.0 and onwards.

**Deprecated APIs**

**Internal API**

#### 6.23.0

**Deprecated APIs**

**Internal API**

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   {% jdoc core::lang.rule.xpath.AbstractXPathRuleQuery %}
*   {% jdoc core::lang.rule.xpath.JaxenXPathRuleQuery %}
*   {% jdoc core::lang.rule.xpath.SaxonXPathRuleQuery %}
*   {% jdoc core::lang.rule.xpath.XPathRuleQuery %}

**In ASTs**

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated in the **Apex**, **Javascript**, **PL/SQL**, **Scala** and **Visualforce** ASTs:

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,
    which for rules, means that they never need to instantiate node themselves.
    Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
  *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.ast.VfNode %} or
      {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package,
      to refer to nodes generically.
  *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The implementation classes of {% jdoc core::lang.Parser %} (eg {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfParser %}) are deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use {% jdoc !!core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler#getParser(ParserOptions) %} instead.
*   The implementation classes of {% jdoc core::lang.TokenManager %} (eg {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfTokenManager %}) are deprecated and should not be used outside of our implementation.
    **This also affects CPD-only modules**.

These deprecations are added to the following language modules in this release.
Please look at the package documentation to find out the full list of deprecations.
* Apex: **{% jdoc_package apex::lang.apex.ast %}**
* Javascript: **{% jdoc_package javascript::lang.ecmascript.ast %}**
* PL/SQL: **{% jdoc_package plsql::lang.plsql.ast %}**
* Scala: **{% jdoc_package scala::lang.scala.ast %}**
* Visualforce: **{% jdoc_package visualforce::lang.vf.ast %}**

These deprecations have already been rolled out in a previous version for the
following languages:
* Java: {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.ast %}
* Java Server Pages: {% jdoc_package jsp::lang.jsp.ast %}
* Velocity Template Language: {% jdoc_package vm::lang.vm.ast %}

Outside of these packages, these changes also concern the following TokenManager
implementations, and their corresponding Parser if it exists (in the same package):

*   {% jdoc cpp::lang.cpp.CppTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc java::lang.java.JavaTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc javascript::lang.ecmascript5.Ecmascript5TokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc jsp::lang.jsp.JspTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc matlab::lang.matlab.MatlabTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc modelica::lang.modelica.ModelicaTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc objectivec::lang.objectivec.ObjectiveCTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc plsql::lang.plsql.PLSQLTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc python::lang.python.PythonTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc vm::lang.vm.VmTokenManager %}


In the **Java AST** the following attributes are deprecated and will issue a warning when used in XPath rules:

*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTAdditiveExpression#getImage() %} - use `getOperator()` instead
*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTVariableDeclaratorId#getImage() %} - use `getName()` instead
*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTVariableDeclaratorId#getVariableName() %} - use `getName()` instead

**For removal**

*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.Parser#getTokenManager(java.lang.String,java.io.Reader) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.TokenManager#setFileName(java.lang.String) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.AbstractTokenManager#setFileName(java.lang.String) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.AbstractTokenManager#getFileName(java.lang.String) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::cpd.token.AntlrToken#getType() %} - use `getKind()` instead.
*   {% jdoc core::lang.rule.ImmutableLanguage %}
*   {% jdoc core::lang.rule.MockRule %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.Node#getFirstParentOfAnyType(java.lang.Class[]) %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.Node#getAsDocument() %}
*   {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.AbstractNode#hasDescendantOfAnyType(java.lang.Class[]) %}
*   {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTRecordDeclaration#getComponentList() %}
*   Multiple fields, constructors and methods in {% jdoc core::lang.rule.XPathRule %}. See javadoc for details.

#### 6.18.0

**Changes to Renderer**

*   Each renderer has now a new method {% jdoc !!core::renderers.Renderer#setUseShortNames(List) %} which
    is used for implementing the "shortnames" CLI option. The method is automatically called by PMD, if this
    CLI option is in use. When rendering filenames to the report, the new helper method
    {% jdoc !!core::renderers.AbstractRenderer#determineFileName(String) %} should be used. This will change
    the filename to a short name, if the CLI option "shortnames" is used.

    Not adjusting custom renderers will make them render always the full file names and not honoring the
    CLI option "shortnames".

**Deprecated APIs**

**For removal**

*   The methods {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTImportDeclaration#getImportedNameNode() %} and
    {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTImportDeclaration#getPackage() %} have been deprecated and

*   The method {% jdoc !!core::RuleContext#setSourceCodeFilename(String) %} has been deprecated
    and will be removed. The already existing method {% jdoc !!core::RuleContext#setSourceCodeFile(File) %}
    should be used instead. The method {% jdoc !!core::RuleContext#getSourceCodeFilename() %} still
    exists and returns just the filename without the full path.
*   The method {% jdoc !!core::processor.AbstractPMDProcessor#filenameFrom(DataSource) %} has been
    deprecated. It was used to determine a "short name" of the file being analyzed, so that the report
    can use short names. However, this logic has been moved to the renderers.
*   The method {% jdoc !!core::Report#metrics() %} and {% jdoc core::Report::hasMetrics() %} have
    been deprecated. They were leftovers from a previous deprecation round targeting
    {% jdoc core::lang.rule.stat.StatisticalRule %}.

* **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. Version 7.0.0 will bring a new set of abstractions that will be public API, but the base classes are and will stay internal. You should not couple your code to them.
  * In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.JavaNode %} or  {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package, to refer to nodes generically.
  * Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
* Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**. We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.

Please look at {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.ast %} to find out the full list
of deprecations.


#### 6.15.0

**Deprecated APIs**

**For removal**

*   The `DumpFacades` in all languages, that could be used to transform a AST into a textual representation,
    will be removed with PMD 7. The rule designer is a better way to inspect nodes.
  *   {% jdoc !q!apex::lang.apex.ast.DumpFacade %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!java::lang.java.ast.DumpFacade %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!javascript::lang.ecmascript.ast.DumpFacade %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!jsp::lang.jsp.ast.DumpFacade %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!plsql::lang.plsql.ast.DumpFacade %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!visualforce::lang.vf.ast.DumpFacade %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!vm::lang.vm.ast.AbstractVmNode#dump(String, boolean, Writer) %}
  *   {% jdoc !q!xml::lang.xml.ast.DumpFacade %}
*   The method {% jdoc !c!core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler#getDumpFacade(Writer, String, boolean) %} will be
    removed as well. It is deprecated, along with all its implementations in the subclasses of {% jdoc core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler %}.

#### 6.14.0

No changes.

#### 6.13.0

**Command Line Interface**

The start scripts `run.sh`, `pmd.bat` and `cpd.bat` support the new environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS`.
This can be used to set arbitrary JVM options for running PMD, such as memory settings (e.g. `PMD_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m`)
or enable preview language features (e.g. `PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview`).

The previously available variables such as `OPTS` or `HEAPSIZE` are deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.

**Deprecated API**

*   {% jdoc core::renderers.CodeClimateRule %} is deprecated in 7.0.0 because it was unused for 2 years and
    created an unwanted dependency.
    Properties "cc_categories", "cc_remediation_points_multiplier", "cc_block_highlighting" will also be removed.
    See [#1702](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/1702) for more.

*   The Apex ruleset `rulesets/apex/ruleset.xml` has been deprecated and will be removed in 7.0.0. Please use the new
    quickstart ruleset `rulesets/apex/quickstart.xml` instead.

#### 6.12.0

No changes.

#### 6.11.0

* {% jdoc core::lang.rule.stat.StatisticalRule %} and the related helper classes and base rule classes
  are deprecated for removal in 7.0.0. This includes all of {% jdoc_package core::stat %} and {% jdoc_package core::lang.rule.stat %},
  and also {% jdoc java::lang.java.rule.AbstractStatisticalJavaRule %}, {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.rule.AbstractStatisticalApexRule %} and the like.
  The methods {% jdoc !c!core::Report#addMetric(core::stat.Metric) %} and {% jdoc core::ThreadSafeReportListener#metricAdded(core::stat.Metric) %}
  will also be removed.
* {% jdoc core::properties.PropertySource#setProperty(core::properties.MultiValuePropertyDescriptor, Object[]) %} is deprecated,
  because {% jdoc core::properties.MultiValuePropertyDescriptor %} is deprecated as well

#### 6.10.0

**Properties framework**

{% jdoc_nspace :props core::properties %}
{% jdoc_nspace :PDr props::PropertyDescriptor %}
{% jdoc_nspace :PF props::PropertyFactory %}

The properties framework is about to get a lifting, and for that reason, we need to deprecate a lot of APIs
to remove them in 7.0.0. The proposed changes to the API are described [on the wiki](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Property-framework-7-0-0)

**Changes to how you define properties**

* Construction of property descriptors has been possible through builders since 6.0.0. The 7.0.0 API will only allow
  construction through builders. The builder hierarchy, currently found in the package {% jdoc_package props::builders %},
  is being replaced by the simpler {% jdoc props::PropertyBuilder %}. Their APIs enjoy a high degree of source compatibility.

* Concrete property classes like {% jdoc props::IntegerProperty %} and {% jdoc props::StringMultiProperty %} will gradually
  all be deprecated until 7.0.0. Their usages should be replaced by direct usage of the {% jdoc props::PropertyDescriptor %}
  interface, e.g. `PropertyDescriptor<Integer>` or `PropertyDescriptor<List<String>>`.

* Instead of spreading properties across countless classes, the utility class {% jdoc :PF %} will become
  from 7.0.0 on the only provider for property descriptor builders. Each current property type will be replaced
  by a corresponding method on `PropertyFactory`:
  * {% jdoc props::IntegerProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#intProperty(java.lang.String) %}
    * {% jdoc props::IntegerMultiProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#intListProperty(java.lang.String) %}

  * {% jdoc props::FloatProperty %} and {% jdoc props::DoubleProperty %} are both replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#doubleProperty(java.lang.String) %}.
    Having a separate property for floats wasn't that useful.
    * Similarly, {% jdoc props::FloatMultiProperty %} and {% jdoc props::DoubleMultiProperty %} are replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#doubleListProperty(java.lang.String) %}.

  * {% jdoc props::StringProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#stringProperty(java.lang.String) %}
    * {% jdoc props::StringMultiProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#stringListProperty(java.lang.String) %}

  * {% jdoc props::RegexProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#regexProperty(java.lang.String) %}

  * {% jdoc props::EnumeratedProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#enumProperty(java.lang.String,java.util.Map) %}
    * {% jdoc props::EnumeratedProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#enumListProperty(java.lang.String,java.util.Map) %}

  * {% jdoc props::BooleanProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#booleanProperty(java.lang.String) %}
    * Its multi-valued counterpart, {% jdoc props::BooleanMultiProperty %}, is not replaced, because it doesn't have a use case.

  * {% jdoc props::CharacterProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#charProperty(java.lang.String) %}
    * {% jdoc props::CharacterMultiProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#charListProperty(java.lang.String) %}

  * {% jdoc props::LongProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#longIntProperty(java.lang.String) %}
    * {% jdoc props::LongMultiProperty %} is replaced by {% jdoc !c!:PF#longIntListProperty(java.lang.String) %}

  * {% jdoc props::MethodProperty %}, {% jdoc props::FileProperty %}, {% jdoc props::TypeProperty %} and their multi-valued counterparts
    are discontinued for lack of a use-case, and have no planned replacement in 7.0.0 for now.
    <!-- TODO complete that as we proceed. -->


Here's an example:
```java
// Before 7.0.0, these are equivalent:
IntegerProperty myProperty = new IntegerProperty("score", "Top score value", 1, 100, 40, 3.0f);
IntegerProperty myProperty = IntegerProperty.named("score").desc("Top score value").range(1, 100).defaultValue(40).uiOrder(3.0f);

// They both map to the following in 7.0.0
PropertyDescriptor<Integer> myProperty = PropertyFactory.intProperty("score").desc("Top score value").require(inRange(1, 100)).defaultValue(40);
```

You're highly encouraged to migrate to using this new API as soon as possible, to ease your migration to 7.0.0.



**Architectural simplifications**

* {% jdoc props::EnumeratedPropertyDescriptor %}, {% jdoc props::NumericPropertyDescriptor %}, {% jdoc props::PackagedPropertyDescriptor %},
  and the related builders (in {% jdoc_package props::builders %}) will be removed.
  These specialized interfaces allowed additional constraints to be enforced on the
  value of a property, but made the property class hierarchy very large and impractical
  to maintain. Their functionality will be mapped uniformly to {% jdoc props::constraints.PropertyConstraint %}s,
  which will allow virtually any constraint to be defined, and improve documentation and error reporting. The
  related methods {% jdoc !c!props::PropertyTypeId#isPropertyNumeric() %} and
  {% jdoc !c!props::PropertyTypeId#isPropertyPackaged() %} are also deprecated.

* {% jdoc props::MultiValuePropertyDescriptor %} and {% jdoc props::SingleValuePropertyDescriptor %}
  are deprecated. 7.0.0 will introduce a new XML syntax which will remove the need for such a divide
  between single- and multi-valued properties. The method {% jdoc !c!:PDr#isMultiValue() %} will be removed
  accordingly.

**Changes to the PropertyDescriptor interface**

* {% jdoc :PDr#preferredRowCount() %} is deprecated with no intended replacement. It was never implemented, and does not belong
  in this interface. The methods {% jdoc :PDr#uiOrder() %} and `compareTo(PropertyDescriptor)` are deprecated for the
  same reason. These methods mix presentation logic with business logic and are not necessary for PropertyDescriptors to work.
  `PropertyDescriptor` will not extend `Comparable<PropertyDescriptor>` anymore come 7.0.0.
* The method {% jdoc :PDr#propertyErrorFor(core::Rule) %} is deprecated and will be removed with no intended
  replacement. It's really just a shortcut for `prop.errorFor(rule.getProperty(prop))`.
* `T `{% jdoc !a!:PDr#valueFrom(java.lang.String) %} and `String `{% jdoc :PDr#asDelimitedString(java.lang.Object) %}`(T)` are deprecated and will be removed. These were
  used to serialize and deserialize properties to/from a string, but 7.0.0 will introduce a more flexible
  XML syntax which will make them obsolete.
* {% jdoc :PDr#isMultiValue() %} and {% jdoc :PDr#type() %} are deprecated and won't be replaced. The new XML syntax will remove the need
  for a divide between multi- and single-value properties, and will allow arbitrary types to be represented.
  Since arbitrary types may be represented, `type` will become obsolete as it can't represent generic types,
  which will nevertheless be representable with the XML syntax. It was only used for documentation, but a
  new way to document these properties exhaustively will be added with 7.0.0.
* {% jdoc :PDr#errorFor(java.lang.Object) %} is deprecated as its return type will be changed to `Optional<String>` with the shift to Java 8.

**Deprecated APIs**

{% jdoc_nspace :xpath core::lang.ast.xpath %}
{% jdoc_nspace :jast java::lang.java.ast %}
{% jdoc_nspace :rule core::Rule %}
{% jdoc_nspace :lvh core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler %}
{% jdoc_nspace :rset core::RuleSet %}
{% jdoc_nspace :rsets core::RuleSets %}

**For internalization**

*   The implementation of the adapters for the XPath engines Saxon and Jaxen (package {% jdoc_package :xpath %})
    are now deprecated. They'll be moved to an internal package come 7.0.0. Only {% jdoc xpath::Attribute %} remains public API.

*   The classes {% jdoc props::PropertyDescriptorField %}, {% jdoc props::builders.PropertyDescriptorBuilderConversionWrapper %}, and the methods
    {% jdoc !c!:PDr#attributeValuesById %}, {% jdoc !c!:PDr#isDefinedExternally() %} and {% jdoc !c!props::PropertyTypeId#getFactory() %}.
    These were used to read and write properties to and from XML, but were not intended as public API.

*   The class {% jdoc props::ValueParserConstants %} and the interface {% jdoc props::ValueParser %}.

*   All classes from {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.metrics.impl.visitors %} are now considered internal API. They're deprecated
    and will be moved into an internal package with 7.0.0. To implement your own metrics visitors,
    {% jdoc jast::JavaParserVisitorAdapter %} should be directly subclassed.

*   {% jdoc !ac!:lvh#getDataFlowHandler() %}, {% jdoc !ac!:lvh#getDFAGraphRule() %}

*   {% jdoc core::lang.VisitorStarter %}

**For removal**

*   All classes from {% jdoc_package props::modules %} will be removed.

*   The interface {% jdoc jast::Dimensionable %} has been deprecated.
    It gets in the way of a grammar change for 7.0.0 and won't be needed anymore (see [#997](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/997)).

*   Several methods from {% jdoc jast::ASTLocalVariableDeclaration %} and {% jdoc jast::ASTFieldDeclaration %} have
    also been deprecated:

  *   {% jdoc jast::ASTFieldDeclaration %} won't be a {% jdoc jast::TypeNode %} come 7.0.0, so
      {% jdoc jast::ASTFieldDeclaration#getType() %} and
      {% jdoc jast::ASTFieldDeclaration#getTypeDefinition() %} are deprecated.

  *   The method `getVariableName` on those two nodes will be removed, too.

    All these are deprecated because those nodes may declare several variables at once, possibly
    with different types (and obviously with different names). They both implement `Iterator<`{% jdoc jast::ASTVariableDeclaratorId %}`>`
    though, so you should iterate on each declared variable. See [#910](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/910).

*   Visitor decorators are now deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7.0.0. They were originally a way to write
    composable visitors, used in the metrics framework, but they didn't prove cost-effective.

  *   In {% jdoc_package :jast %}: {% jdoc jast::JavaParserDecoratedVisitor %}, {% jdoc jast::JavaParserControllessVisitor %},
      {% jdoc jast::JavaParserControllessVisitorAdapter %}, and {% jdoc jast::JavaParserVisitorDecorator %} are deprecated with no intended replacement.


*   The LanguageModules of several languages, that only support CPD execution, have been deprecated. These languages
    are not fully supported by PMD, so having a language module does not make sense. The functionality of CPD is
    not affected by this change. The following classes have been deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0:

  *   {% jdoc cpp::lang.cpp.CppHandler %}
  *   {% jdoc cpp::lang.cpp.CppLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc cpp::lang.cpp.CppParser %}
  *   {% jdoc cs::lang.cs.CsLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc fortran::lang.fortran.FortranLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc groovy::lang.groovy.GroovyLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc matlab::lang.matlab.MatlabHandler %}
  *   {% jdoc matlab::lang.matlab.MatlabLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc matlab::lang.matlab.MatlabParser %}
  *   {% jdoc objectivec::lang.objectivec.ObjectiveCHandler %}
  *   {% jdoc objectivec::lang.objectivec.ObjectiveCLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc objectivec::lang.objectivec.ObjectiveCParser %}
  *   {% jdoc php::lang.php.PhpLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc python::lang.python.PythonHandler %}
  *   {% jdoc python::lang.python.PythonLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc python::lang.python.PythonParser %}
  *   {% jdoc ruby::lang.ruby.RubyLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc scala::lang.scala.ScalaLanguageModule %}
  *   {% jdoc swift::lang.swift.SwiftLanguageModule %}


* Optional AST processing stages like symbol table, type resolution or data-flow analysis will be reified
  in 7.0.0 to factorise common logic and make them extensible. Further explanations about this change can be
  found on [#1426](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/1426). Consequently, the following APIs are deprecated for
  removal:
  * In {% jdoc :rule %}: {% jdoc !a!:rule#isDfa() %}, {% jdoc !a!:rule#isTypeResolution() %}, {% jdoc !a!:rule#isMultifile() %} and their
    respective setters.
  * In {% jdoc :rset %}: {% jdoc !a!:rset#usesDFA(core::lang.Language) %}, {% jdoc !a!:rset#usesTypeResolution(core::lang.Language) %}, {% jdoc !a!:rset#usesMultifile(core::lang.Language) %}
  * In {% jdoc :rsets %}: {% jdoc !a!:rsets#usesDFA(core::lang.Language) %}, {% jdoc !a!:rsets#usesTypeResolution(core::lang.Language) %}, {% jdoc !a!:rsets#usesMultifile(core::lang.Language) %}
  * In {% jdoc :lvh %}: {% jdoc !a!:lvh#getDataFlowFacade() %}, {% jdoc !a!:lvh#getSymbolFacade() %}, {% jdoc !a!:lvh#getSymbolFacade(java.lang.ClassLoader) %},
    {% jdoc !a!:lvh#getTypeResolutionFacade(java.lang.ClassLoader) %}, {% jdoc !a!:lvh#getQualifiedNameResolutionFacade(java.lang.ClassLoader) %}

#### 6.9.0

No changes.

#### 6.8.0

*   A couple of methods and fields in `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.AbstractPropertySource` have been
    deprecated, as they are replaced by already existing functionality or expose internal implementation
    details: `propertyDescriptors`, `propertyValuesByDescriptor`,
    `copyPropertyDescriptors()`, `copyPropertyValues()`, `ignoredProperties()`, `usesDefaultValues()`,
    `useDefaultValueFor()`.

*   Some methods in `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.PropertySource` have been deprecated as well:
    `usesDefaultValues()`, `useDefaultValueFor()`, `ignoredProperties()`.

*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.AbstractDelegateRule` has been deprecated and will
    be removed with PMD 7.0.0. It is internally only in use by RuleReference.

*   The default constructor of `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.RuleReference` has been deprecated
    and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. RuleReferences should only be created by providing a Rule and
    a RuleSetReference. Furthermore the following methods are deprecated: `setRuleReference()`,
    `hasOverriddenProperty()`, `usesDefaultValues()`, `useDefaultValueFor()`.

#### 6.7.0

*   All classes in the package `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.report` have been deprecated and will be removed
    with PMD 7.0.0. This includes the class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.report.ReportTree`. The reason is,
    that this class is very specific to Java and not suitable for other languages. It has only been used for
    `YAHTMLRenderer`, which has been rewritten to work without these classes.

*   The nodes RUNSIGNEDSHIFT and RSIGNEDSHIFT are deprecated and will be removed from the AST with PMD 7.0.0.
    These represented the operator of ShiftExpression in two cases out of three, but they're not needed and
    make ShiftExpression inconsistent. The operator of a ShiftExpression is now accessible through
    ShiftExpression#getOperator.

#### 6.5.0

*   The utility class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast.CommentUtil` has been deprecated and will be removed
    with PMD 7.0.0. Its methods have been intended to parse javadoc tags. A more useful solution will be added
    around the AST node `FormalComment`, which contains as children `JavadocElement` nodes, which in
    turn provide access to the `JavadocTag`.

    All comment AST nodes (`FormalComment`, `MultiLineComment`, `SingleLineComment`) have a new method
    `getFilteredComment()` which provide access to the comment text without the leading `/*` markers.

*   The method `AbstractCommentRule.tagsIndicesIn()` has been deprecated and will be removed with
    PMD 7.0.0. It is not very useful, since it doesn't extract the information
    in a useful way. You would still need check, which tags have been found, and with which
    data they might be accompanied.

#### 6.4.0

* The following classes in package `net.sourceforge.pmd.benchmark` have been deprecated: `Benchmark`, `Benchmarker`,
  `BenchmarkReport`, `BenchmarkResult`, `RuleDuration`, `StringBuilderCR` and `TextReport`. Their API is not supported anymore
  and is disconnected from the internals of PMD. Use the newer API based around `TimeTracker` instead, which can be found
  in the same package.
* The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.xpath.TypeOfFunction` has been deprecated. Use the newer `TypeIsFunction` in the same package.
* The `typeof` methods in `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.xpath.JavaFunctions` have been deprecated.
  Use the newer `typeIs` method in the same class instead..
* The methods `isA`, `isEither` and `isNeither` of `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.typeresolution.TypeHelper`.
  Use the new `isExactlyAny` and `isExactlyNone` methods in the same class instead.

#### 6.2.0

*   The static method `PMDParameters.transformParametersIntoConfiguration(PMDParameters)` is now deprecated,
    for removal in 7.0.0. The new instance method `PMDParameters.toConfiguration()` replaces it.

*   The method `ASTConstructorDeclaration.getParameters()` has been deprecated in favor of the new method
    `getFormalParameters()`. This method is available for both `ASTConstructorDeclaration` and
    `ASTMethodDeclaration`.

#### 6.1.0

* The method `getXPathNodeName` is added to the `Node` interface, which removes the
  use of the `toString` of a node to get its XPath element name (see [#569](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/569)).
  * The default implementation provided in  `AbstractNode`, will
    be removed with 7.0.0
  * With 7.0.0, the `Node.toString` method will not necessarily provide its XPath node
    name anymore.

* The interface `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Renderer` has been deprecated. A new interface
  `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.renderer.CPDRenderer` has been introduced to replace it. The main
  difference is that the new interface is meant to render directly to a `java.io.Writer`
  rather than to a String. This allows to greatly reduce the memory footprint of CPD, as on
  large projects, with many duplications, it was causing `OutOfMemoryError`s (see [#795](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/795)).

  `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.FileReporter` has also been deprecated as part of this change, as it's no longer needed.

#### 6.0.1

*   The constant `net.sourceforge.pmd.PMD.VERSION` has been deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.
    Please use `net.sourceforge.pmd.PMDVersion.VERSION` instead.
