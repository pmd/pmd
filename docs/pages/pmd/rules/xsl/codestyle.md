## UseConcatOnce

**Since:** PMD 5.0

**Priority:** Medium (3)

The XPath concat() functions accepts as many arguments as required so you can have
&quot;concat($a,'b',$c)&quot; rather than &quot;concat($a,concat('b',$c)&quot;.

**This rule is defined by the following XPath expression:**
``` xpath
//node()[contains(substring-after(@select,'concat'),'concat')]
```

**Example(s):**

``` xsl
<xsl:variable name="var" select="concat("Welcome",concat("to you ",$name))"/>
<xsl:variable name="var" select="concat("Welcome","to you ",$name))">
```

**Use this rule by referencing it:**
``` xml
<rule ref="category/xsl/codestyle.xml/UseConcatOnce" />
```
