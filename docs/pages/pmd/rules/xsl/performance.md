## AvoidAxisNavigation

**Since:** PMD 5.0

**Priority:** Medium (3)

Avoid using the 'following' or 'preceeding' axes whenever possible, as these can cut
through 100% of the document in the worst case.  Also, try to avoid using 'descendant'
or 'descendant-self' axes, as if you're at the top of the Document, it necessarily means
cutting through 100% of the document.

**This rule is defined by the following XPath expression:**
``` xpath
//node()[
  contains(@select,'preceeding::')
  or
  contains(@select,'following::')
  or
  contains(@select,'descendant::')
  or 
  contains(@select,'descendant-self::')
  or (
    ($checkSelfDescendantAbreviation = 'true' )
    and
    contains(@select,'//')
    )
]
```

**Example(s):**

``` xsl
<xsl:variable name="var" select="//item/descendant::child"/>
```

**This rule has the following properties:**

|Name|Default Value|Description|Multivalued|
|----|-------------|-----------|-----------|
|checkSelfDescendantAbreviation|false|descendant::self abreviation, '//', will also trigger this rule.|no|

**Use this rule by referencing it:**
``` xml
<rule ref="category/xsl/performance.xml/AvoidAxisNavigation" />
```
