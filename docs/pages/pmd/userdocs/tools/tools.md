tools in various programming languages.

Using TCA can help team find normative, structural, security vulnerabilities and other issues in the code,
continuously monitor the quality of the project code and issue alerts. At the same time, TCA opens up APIs to
support connection with upstream and downstream systems, so as to integrate code analysis capabilities, ensure
code quality, and be more conducive to inheriting an excellent team code culture.

With TCA you have PMD analysis out-of-the-box, and it is open source under the MIT license.
