## Introduction

PMD can be integrate through some of the Continuous Integration tools that exist now.
Here is a list of known (to us) plugin to do so.

## Jenkins Plugin

[Ullrich Hafner](https://github.com/uhafner) developed the
[Warnings Next Generation](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/) plugin for Jenkins. It supports
PMD among many other linting tools.

result of the PMD maven plugin.

## MegaLinter

[ðŸ¦™ Mega-Linter](https://oxsecurity.github.io/megalinter/latest/) analyzes 50 languages, 22 formats, 21 tooling formats, excessive copy-pastes, spelling mistakes and security issues in your repository sources with a GitHub Action, other CI tools or locally.

It [natively embeds PMD](https://oxsecurity.github.io/megalinter/latest/descriptors/java_pmd/).
