## Options

The tool comes with a rather extensive help text, simply running with `--help`!

## Additional Java Runtime Options

PMD is executed via a Java runtime. In some cases, you might need to set additional runtime options, e.g.
if you want to analyze a project, that uses one of OpenJDK's [JEP 12: Preview Language Features](https://openjdk.org/jeps/12).

Just set the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` before executing PMD, e.g.

{% include cli_example.html
   id="preview"
   linux="export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=\"--enable-preview\"
    pmd check -d src/main/java/ -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml"
   windows="set \"PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\"
    pmd.bat check -d src\main\java\ -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml" %}

## Additional runtime classpath

If you develop custom rules and package them as a jar file, you need to add it to PMD's runtime classpath.
You can either copy the jar file into the `lib/` subfolder alongside the other jar files, that are in PMD's
standard distribution.

Or you can set the environment variable `CLASSPATH` before starting PMD, e.g.

{% include cli_example.html
   id="preview_classpath"
   linux="export CLASSPATH=custom-rule-example.jar
    pmd check -d ../../../src/main/java/ -f text -R myrule.xml"
   windows="set CLASSPATH=custom-rule-example.jar
    pmd.bat check -d ..\..\..\src\main\java\ -f text -R myrule.xml" %}

## Exit Status

Please note that if PMD detects any violations, it will exit with status 4 (since 5.3) or 5 (since 7.3.0).
This behavior has been introduced to ease PMD integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Everything is fine, no violations found and no recoverable error occurred.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>PMD exited with an exception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Usage error. Command-line parameters are invalid or missing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least one violation has been detected, unless <code>--no-fail-on-violation</code> is set.<p>Since PMD 5.3.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>At least one recoverable error has occurred. There might be additionally zero or more violations detected.
    To ignore recoverable errors, use <code>--no-fail-on-error</code>.<p>Since PMD 7.3.0.</p></td></tr>
</table>

{%include note.html content="If PMD exits with 5, then PMD had either trouble parsing one or more files or a rule failed with an exception.
That means, that either no violations for the entire file or for that rule are reported. These cases can be considered as false-negatives.
In any case, the root cause should be investigated. If it's a problem in PMD itself, please create a bug report. Recoverable errors
are usually part of the generated PMD report." %}

## Logging

PMD internally uses [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/) and ships with slf4j-simple as the logging implementation.
Logging messages are printed to System.err, that's why you should use `--report-file` to specify an output for
the report and not rely on redirecting the console output.

The configuration for slf4j-simple is in the file `conf/simplelogger.properties`. There you can enable
logging of specific classes if needed. The `--debug` command line option configures the default log level
to be "debug".

## Supported Languages

The language is determined automatically by PMD from the file extensions. Some languages such as "Java"
however support multiple versions. The default version will be used, which is usually the latest supported
non-preview version. If you want to use an older version, so that e.g. rules that suggest usage of language features
that are not available yet won't be executed, you need to specify a specific version via the `--use-version`
parameter.

The selected language version can also influence which rules are applied. Some rules might be relevant for
just a specific version of the language. Such rules are marked with either `minimumLanguageVersion` or
`maximumLanguageVersion` or both. Most rules apply for all language versions.

These parameters are most of the time irrelevant, if the rules apply for all versions.

The available versions depend on the language. You can get a list of the currently supported language versions
via the CLI option `--help`.

Example:

{% include cli_example.html
   id="lang-ver"
   linux="pmd check -d src/main/java -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml --use-version java-1.8"
   windows="pmd.bat check -d src\main\java -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml --use-version java-1.8" %}

## Available Report Formats

PMD comes with many different renderers.
All formats are described at [PMD Report formats](pmd_userdocs_report_formats.html)

## Examples

### Analyze other xml formats

If your xml language doesn't use `xml` as file extension, you can still use PMD with `--force-language`:

{% include cli_example.html
   id="force"
   linux="pmd check -d src/xml-file.ext -f text -R ruleset.xml --force-language xml"
   windows="pmd.bat check -d src\xml-file.ext -f text -R ruleset.xml --force-language xml" %}

You can also specify a directory instead of a single file. Then all files are analyzed. In that case,
parse errors are suppressed in order to reduce irrelevant noise:

{% include cli_example.html
   id="force-dir"
   linux="pmd check -d src/ -f text -R ruleset.xml --force-language xml"
   windows="pmd.bat check -d src\ -f text -R ruleset.xml --force-language xml" %}

Alternatively, you can create a filelist to only analyze files with a given extension:

{% include cli_example.html
   id="file-list"
   linux="find src/ -name \"*.ext\" > filelist.txt
     pmd check --file-list filelist.txt -f text -R ruleset.xml --force-language xml"
   windows="for /r src\ %i in (*.ext) do echo %i >> filelist.txt
     pmd.bat check --file-list filelist.txt -f text -R ruleset.xml --force-language xml" %}
