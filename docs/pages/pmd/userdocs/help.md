There are numerous ways of getting help:

*   Search for already existing questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

*   If you can't find your problem, post a new question. Don't forget to tag the question with [`pmd`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pmd).

*   If you found a bug, please create a new [github issue](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues).

*   You can also ask questions in our [sourceforge forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/discussion/).

*   Or you can join the [Mailing List](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pmd-devel) or browse
    through the archives ([archive1](http://java-pmd.30631.n5.nabble.com/), [archive2](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.audit.pmd.devel)).

*   Of course, you can also directly jump to our [source code on github](https://github.com/pmd/pmd).
