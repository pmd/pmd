This page describes some points of XPath rule support in more details. See
also [the tutorial about how to write an XPath rule](pmd_userdocs_extending_your_first_rule.html).

<!-- Later we can document the specific subset of XPath features our wrappers support -->

## XPath version

PMD uses XPath 3.1 for its XPath rules since PMD 7. Before then, the default version was XPath 1.0, with opt-in support for XPath 2.0.

See [the Saxonica documentation](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/expressions/xpath31new.html) for an introduction to new features in XPath 3.1.

The property `version` of XPathRule is deprecated and will be removed.


## DOM representation of ASTs

XPath rules view the AST as an XML-like DOM, which is what the XPath language is
defined on. Concretely, this means:
* Every AST node is viewed as an XML element
  * The element has for local name the value of {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node#getXPathNodeName() %}
  for the given node
* Some Java getters are exposed as XML attributes on those elements
  * This means, that documentation for attributes can be found in our Javadocs. For
  example, the attribute `@SimpleName` of the Java node `EnumDeclaration` is backed
  by the Java getter {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTAnyTypeDeclaration#getSimpleName() %}.

### Value conversion

To represent attributes, we must map Java values to [XPath Data Model (XDM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/) values. In the following table we refer to the type conversion function as `conv`, a function from Java types to XDM types.

| Java type `T` | XSD type `conv(T)`
|-----------------|---------------------|
|`int`            | `xs:integer`
|`long`           | `xs:integer`
|`double`         | `xs:decimal`
|`float`          | `xs:decimal`
|`boolean`        | `xs:boolean`
|`String`         | `xs:string`
|`Character`      | `xs:string`
|`Enum<E>`        | `xs:string` (uses `Object::toString`)
|`List<E>`        | `conv(E)*` (a sequence type)


The same `conv` function is used to translate rule property values to XDM values.

## Migrating from 1.0 to 2.0

<!-- TODO should this still be there in PMD 7? We could just link to an older version of the doc, as this is not so relevant. -->

XPath 1.0 and 2.0 have some incompatibilities. The [XPath 2.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/#id-incompat-in-false-mode)
describes them precisely. Those are however mostly corner cases and XPath
rules usually don't feature any of them.

The incompatibilities that are most relevant to migrating your rules are not
caused by the specification, but by the different engines we use to run
XPath 1.0 and 2.0 queries. Here's a list of known incompatibilities:

* The namespace prefixes `fn:` and `string:` should not be mentioned explicitly.
In XPath 2.0 mode, the engine will complain about an undeclared namespace, but
the functions are in the default namespace. Removing the namespace prefixes fixes it.
   * <code><b style="color:red">fn:</b>substring("Foo", 1)</code> &rarr; `substring("Foo", 1)`
* Conversely, calls to custom PMD functions like `typeIs` *must* be prefixed
with the namespace of the declaring module (`pmd-java`).
   * `typeIs("Foo")` &rarr; <code><b style="color:green">pmd-java:</b>typeIs("Foo")</code>
* Boolean attribute values on our 1.0 engine are represented as the string values
`"true"` and `"false"`. In 2.0 mode though, boolean values are truly represented
as boolean values, which in XPath may only be obtained through the functions
`true()` and `false()`.
If your XPath 1.0 rule tests an attribute like `@Private="true"`, then it just
needs to be changed to `@Private=true()` when migrating. A type error will warn
you that you must update the comparison. More is explained on [issue #1244](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1244).
   * `"true"`, `'true'` &rarr; `true()`
   * `"false"`, `'false'` &rarr; `false()`

* In XPath 1.0, comparing a number to a string coerces the string to a number.
In XPath 2.0, a type error occurs. Like for boolean values, numeric values are
represented by our 1.0 implementation as strings, meaning that `@BeginLine > "1"`
worked ---that's not the case in 2.0 mode.
   * <code>@ArgumentCount > <b style="color:red">'</b>1<b style="color:red">'</b></code> &rarr; `@ArgumentCount > 1`

* In XPath 1.0, the expression `/Foo` matches the *children* of the root named `Foo`.
In XPath 2.0, that expression matches the root, if it is named `Foo`. Consider the following tree:
```java
Foo
└─ Foo
└─ Foo
```
Then `/Foo` will match the root in XPath 2, and the other nodes (but not the root) in XPath 1.
See eg [an issue caused by this](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1919#issuecomment-512865434) in Apex,
with nested classes.


## Rule properties

**See [Defining rule properties](pmd_userdocs_extending_defining_properties.html#for-xpath-rules)**


## PMD extension functions

PMD provides some language-specific XPath functions to access semantic
information from the AST.

On XPath 2.0, the namespace of custom PMD function must be explicitly mentioned.

{% render %}
{% include custom/xpath_fun_doc.html %}
{% endrender %}

{% include note.html content='There is also a `typeOf` function which is
deprecated and whose usages should be replaced with uses of `typeIs` or
`typeIsExactly`. That one will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.' %}
