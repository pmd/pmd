First of all, thanks for the contribution!

Happily for you, to add CPD support for a new language is now easier than ever!

{% include callout.html content="**Pro Tip**: If you wish to add a new language, there are more than 50 languages you could easily add with just an [Antlr grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4)." type="primary" %}

All you need to do is follow this few steps:

1. Create a new module for your language, you can take [the Golang module](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/tree/master/pmd-go) as an example
   *   Make sure to add your new module to the parent pom as `<module>` entry, so that it is built alongside the
       other languages.
   *   Also add your new module to the dependencies list in "pmd-languages-deps/pom.xml", so that the new language
       is automatically available in the binary distribution (pmd-dist) as well as for the shell-completion
       in the pmd-cli module.

2. Create a Tokenizer
    
    - For Antlr grammars you can take the grammar from [here](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) and
      extend [AntlrTokenizer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/impl/AntlrTokenizer.java) 
      taking Go as an example
    
    ```java 
      public class GoTokenizer extends AntlrTokenizer {    
        
          @Override protected AntlrTokenManager getLexerForSource(SourceCode sourceCode) {   
              CharStream charStream = AntlrTokenizer.getCharStreamFromSourceCode(sourceCode);   
              return new AntlrTokenManager(new GolangLexer(charStream), sourceCode.getFileName());   
          }
      }
    ```
    
    - For JavaCC grammars you should subclass [JavaCCTokenizer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/impl/JavaCCTokenizer.java)
      which has many examples you could follow, you should also take the
      [Python implementation](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-python/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/PythonTokenizer.java) as reference
    - For any other scenario you can use [AnyTokenizer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/AnyTokenizer.java)

 If you're using Antlr or JavaCC, update the pom.xml of your submodule to use the appropriate ant wrapper. See `pmd-go/pom.xml` and `pmd-python/pom.xml` for examples.

3. Create your [Language](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/AbstractLanguage.java) class
    
    ```java 
    public class GoLanguage extends AbstractLanguage {    
        
        public GoLanguage() {   
            super("Go", "go", new GoTokenizer(), ".go");   
        }  
    } 
    ``` 
    
    {% include callout.html content="**Pro Tip**: Yes, keep looking at Go!" type="primary" %}
    
    **You are almost there!**
    
4. Update the list of supported languages

   - Write the fully-qualified name of your Language class to the file `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Language`

   - Update the test that asserts the list of supported languages by updating the `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` constant in [BinaryDistributionIT](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-dist/src/test/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/it/BinaryDistributionIT.java)

5. Please don't forget to add some test, you can again.. look at Go implementation ;)
    
    If you read this far, I'm keen to think you would also love to support some extra CPD configuration (ignore imports or crazy things like that)    
    If that's your case , you came to the right place! 
    
6. You can add your custom properties using a Token filter
    
    -   For Antlr grammars all you need to do is implement your own [AntlrTokenFilter](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/token/AntlrTokenFilter.java)
        
        And by now, I know where you are going to look...
        
        **WRONG**  
        
        Why do you want GO to solve all your problems?
        
        You should take a look to [Kotlin token filter implementation](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-kotlin/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/KotlinTokenizer.java)
    
    - For non-Antlr grammars you can use [BaseTokenFilter](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/token/internal/BaseTokenFilter.java) directly or take a peek to [Java's token filter](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/JavaTokenizer.java)  


### Testing your implementation

Add a Maven dependency on `pmd-lang-test` (scope `test`) in your `pom.xml`.
This contains utilities to test your Tokenizer.

For simple tests, create a test class extending from `CpdTextComparisonTest`.
That class is written in Kotlin, but you can extend it in Java as well.

To add tests, you need to write regular JUnit `@Test`-annotated methods, and
call the method `doTest` with the name of the test file.

For example, for the Dart language:

```java

public class DartTokenizerTest extends CpdTextComparisonTest {

    /**********************************
      Implementation of the superclass
    ***********************************/


    public DartTokenizerTest() {
        super(".dart"); // the file extension for the dart language
    }

    @Override
    protected String getResourcePrefix() {
        // If your class is in                  src/test/java     /some/package
        // you need to place the test files in  src/test/resources/some/package/cpdData
        return "cpdData";
    }

    @Override
    public Tokenizer newTokenizer() {
        // Override this abstract method to return the correct tokenizer
        return new DartTokenizer();
    }

    /**************
      Test methods
    ***************/


    @Test  // don't forget the JUnit annotation
    public void testLiterals() {
        // This will look for a file named literals.dart
        // in the directory identified by getResourcePrefix,
        // tokenize it, then compare the result against a baseline
        // literals.txt file in the same directory

        // If the baseline file does not exist, it is created automatically
        doTest("literals");
    }

}
```
