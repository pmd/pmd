**Before you start...**<br><br>

This is really a big contribution and can't be done with a drive by contribution. It requires dedicated passion
and long commitment to implement support for a new language.<br><br>

This step-by-step guide is just a small intro to get the basics started, and it's also not necessarily up-to-date
or complete. You have to be able to fill in the blanks.<br><br>

After the basic support for a language is there, there are lots of missing features left. Typical features
that can greatly improve rule writing are: symbol table, type resolution, call/data flow analysis.<br><br>

Symbol table keeps track of variables and their usages. Type resolution tries to find the actual class type
of each used type, following along method calls (including overloaded and overwritten methods), allowing
to query subtypes and type hierarchy. This requires additional configuration of an auxiliary classpath.
Call and data flow analysis keep track of the data as it is moving through different execution paths
a program has.<br><br>

These features are out of scope of this guide. Type resolution and data flow are features that
definitely don't come for free. It is much effort and requires perseverance to implement.<br><br>

## Steps

### 1.  Start with a new sub-module
*   See pmd-java or pmd-vm for examples.
*   Make sure to add your new module to PMD's parent pom as `<module>` entry, so that it is built alongside the
    other languages.
*   Also add your new module to the dependencies list in "pmd-languages-deps/pom.xml", so that the new language
    is automatically available in the binary distribution (pmd-dist).

### 2.  Implement an AST parser for your language
*   Ideally an AST parser should be implemented as a JJT file *(see VmParser.jjt or Java.jjt for example)*.
    The grammar files are placed in directory `src/main/javacc`.
*   There is nothing preventing any other parser implementation, as long as you have some way to convert an input
    stream into an AST tree. Doing it as a JJT simplifies maintenance down the road.
*   See this link for reference: [https://javacc.java.net/doc/JJTree.html](https://javacc.java.net/doc/JJTree.html)

### 3.  Create AST node classes
*   For each AST node that your parser can generate, there should be a class
*   The name of the AST class should be “AST” + “whatever is the name of the node in JJT file”.
    *   For example, if JJT contains a node called “IfStatement”, there should be a class called “ASTIfStatement”
*   Each AST class should have one package-private constructor, that takes an `int id`.
*   It’s a good idea to create a parent AST class for all AST classes of the language. This simplifies rule
    creation later. *(see SimpleNode for Velocity and AbstractJavaNode for Java for example)*
*   Note: These AST node classes are generated usually once by javacc/jjtree and can then be modified as needed.
*   You can add additional methods in your AST node classes, that can be used in rules. Most getters
    are also available for XPath rules, see section [XPath integration](#xpath-integration) below.

### 4.  Generate your parser (using JJT)
*   An ant script is being used to compile jjt files into classes. This is in `javacc-wrapper.xml` file in the
    top-level pmd sources.
*   The ant script is executed via the `maven-antrun-plugin`. Add this plugin to your `pom.xml` file and configure
    it the language name. You can use `pmd-java/pom.xml` as an example.
*   The ant script is called in the phase `generate-sources` whenever the whole project is built. But you can
    call `./mvnw generate-sources` directly for your module if you want your parser to be generated.

### 5.  Create a PMD parser “adapter”
*   Create a new class that extends `JjtreeParserAdapter`.
*   This is a generic class, and you need to declare the root AST node.
*   There are two important methods to implement
    *   `tokenBehavior` method should return a new instance of `TokenDocumentBehavior` constructed with the list
        of tokes in your language. The compile step #4 will generate a class `$langTokenKinds` which has
        all the available tokens in the field `TOKEN_NAMES`.
    *   `parseImpl` method should return the root node of the AST tree obtained by parsing the CharStream source
    *   See `VmParser` class as an example

### 6.  Create a language version handler
*   Extend `AbstractPmdLanguageVersionHandler` *(see VmHandler for example)*
*   This class is sort of a gateway between PMD and all parsing logic specific to your language.
*   For a minimal implementation, it just needs to return a parser *(see step #5)*.
*   It can be used to provide other features for your language like
    *   violation suppression logic
    *   {% jdoc core::reporting.ViolationDecorator %}s, to add additional language specific information to the
        created violations. The [Java language module](pmd_languages_java.html#violation-decorators) uses this to
        provide the method name or class name, where the violation occurred.
    *   metrics (see below "Optional features")
    *   custom XPath functions
*   See `VmHandler` class as an example

### 7.  Create a base visitor
*   A parser visitor adapter is not needed anymore with PMD 7. The visitor interface now provides a default
    implementation.
*   The visitor for JavaCC based AST is generated along the parser from the grammar file. The
    base interface for a visitor is [`AstVisitor`](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/main/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/AstVisitor.java).
*   The generated visitor class for VM is called `VmVisitor`.
*   In order to help use this visitor later on, a base visitor class should be created.
    See `VmVisitorBase` as an example.

### 8. Make PMD recognize your language
*   Create your own subclass of `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.impl.SimpleLanguageModuleBase`. *(see VmLanguageModule or
    JavaLanguageModule as an example)*
*   Add for each version of your language a call to `addVersion` in your language module’s constructor.
    Use `addDefaultVersion` for defining the default version.
*   You’ll need to refer the language version handler created in step #6.
*   Create the service registration via the text file `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.Language`.
    Add your fully qualified class name as a single line into it.

### 9. Add AST regression tests

For languages, that use an external library for parsing, the AST can easily change when upgrading the library.
Also for languages, where we have the grammar under our control, it is useful to have such tests.

The tests parse one or more source files and generate a textual representation of the AST. This text is compared
against a previously recorded version. If there are differences, the test fails.

This helps to detect anything in the AST structure that changed, maybe unexpectedly.

*   Create a test class in the package `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.$lang.ast` with the name `$langTreeDumpTest`.
*   This test class must extend `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.test.ast.BaseTreeDumpTest`. Note: This class
    is written in kotlin and is available in the module "lang-test".
*   Add a default constructor, that calls the super constructor like so:
    
    ```java
        public $langTreeDumpTest() {
            super(NodePrintersKt.getSimpleNodePrinter(), ".$extension");
        }
    ```
    
    Replace "$lang" and "$extension" accordingly.
*   Implement the method `getParser()`. It must return a
    subclass of `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.test.ast.BaseParsingHelper`. See 
    `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.ecmascript.ast.JsParsingHelper` for an example.
    With this parser helper you can also specify, where the test files are searched, by using
    the method `withResourceContext(Class<?>, String)`.
*   Add one or more test methods. Each test method parses one file and compares the result. The base
    class has a helper method `doTest(String)` that does all the work. This method just needs to be called:
    
    ```java
        @Test
        public void myFirstAstTest() {
            doTest("filename-without-extension");
        }
    ```
*   On the first test run the test fails. A text file (with the extension `.txt`) is created, that records the
    current AST. On the next run, the text file is used as comparison and the test should pass. Don't forget
    to commit the generated text file.

A complete example can be seen in the JavaScript module: `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.ecmascript.ast.JsTreeDumpTest`.
The test resources are in the subpackage "testdata": `pmd-javascript/src/test/resources/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ecmascript/ast/testdata/`.

The Scala module also has a test, written in Kotlin instead of Java:
`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.scala.ast.ScalaParserTests`.


### 10. Create an abstract rule class for the language
*   Extend `AbstractRule` and implement the parser visitor interface for your language *(see AbstractVmRule for example)*
*   All other rules for your language should extend this class. The purpose of this class is to implement visit
    methods for all AST types to simply delegate to default behavior. This is useful because most rules care only
    about specific AST nodes, but PMD needs to know what to do with each node - so this just lets you use default
    behavior for nodes you don’t care about.

### 11. Create rules
*   Rules are created by extending the abstract rule class created in step 9 *(see `EmptyForeachStmtRule` for example)*
*   Creating rules is already pretty well documented in PMD - and it’s no different for a new language,
    except you may have different AST nodes.

### 12. Test the rules
*   Testing rules is described in depth in [Testing your rules](pmd_userdocs_extending_testing.html).
    *   Each rule has its own test class: Create a test class for your rule extending `PmdRuleTst`
        *(see AvoidReassigningParametersTest in pmd-vm for example)*
    *   Create a category rule set for your language *(see category/vm/bestpractices.xml for example)*
    *   Place the test XML file with the test cases in the correct location
    *   When executing the test class
        *   this triggers the unit test to read the corresponding XML file with the rule test data
            *(see `AvoidReassigningParameters.xml` for example)*
        *   This test XML file contains sample pieces of code which should trigger a specified number of
            violations of this rule. The unit test will execute the rule on this piece of code, and verify
            that the number of violations matches.
*   To verify the validity of the created ruleset, create a subclass of `AbstractRuleSetFactoryTest`
    (*see `RuleSetFactoryTest` in pmd-vm for example)*.
    This will load all rulesets and verify, that all required attributes are provided.

    *Note:* You'll need to add your category ruleset to `categories.properties`, so that it can be found.

### 13. Create documentation page
Finishing up your new language module by adding a page in the documentation. Create a new markdown file
`<langId>.md` in `docs/pages/pmd/languages/`. This file should have the following frontmatter:

```
---
title: <Language Name>
permalink: pmd_languages_<langId>.html
last_updated: <Month> <Year> (<PMD Version>)
tags: [languages, PmdCapableLanguage, CpdCapableLanguage]
---
```

On this page, language specifics can be documented, e.g. when the language was first supported by PMD.
There is also the following Jekyll Include, that creates summary box for the language:

```
{% raw %}
{% include language_info.html name='<Language Name>' id='<langId>' implementation='<langId>::lang.<langId>.<langId>LanguageModule' supports_cpd=true supports_pmd=true %}
{% endraw %}
```

## XPath integration

PMD exposes the AST nodes for use by XPath based rules (see [DOM representation of ASTs](pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_xpath_rules.html#dom-representation-of-asts)).
Most Java getters in the AST classes are made available by default. These getters constitute the API of the language.
If a getter method is renamed, then every XPath rule that uses this getter also needs to be adjusted. In order to
have more control over this, there are two annotations that can be used for AST classes and their methods:

* {% jdoc core::lang.rule.xpath.DeprecatedAttribute %}: Getters might be annotated with that indicating, that
  this getter method should not be used in XPath rules. When a XPath rule uses such a method, a warning is
  issued. If the method additionally has the standard Java `@Deprecated` annotation, then the getter is also
  deprecated for java usage. Otherwise, the getter is only deprecated for usage in XPath rules.

  When a getter is deprecated and there is a different getter to be used instead, then the
  attribute `replaceWith` should be used.

* {% jdoc core::lang.rule.xpath.NoAttribute %}: This annotation can be used on an AST node type or on individual
  methods in order to filter out which methods are available for XPath rules.
  When used on a type, either all methods can be filtered or only inherited methods (see attribute `scope`).
  When used directly on an individual method, then only this method will be filtered out.
  That way methods can be added in AST nodes, that should only be used in Java rules, e.g. as auxiliary methods.

{% include note.html content="
Not all getters are available for XPath rules. It depends on the result type.
Especially **Lists** or Collections in general are **not supported**." %}

Only the following Java result types are supported:
* String
* any Enum-type
* int
* boolean
* double
* long
* char
* float

## Debugging with Rule Designer

When implementing your grammar it may be very useful to see how PMD parses your example files.
This can be achieved with Rule Designer:
*   Override the `getXPathNodeName` in your AST nodes for Designer to show node names.
*   Make sure to override both `jjtOpen` and `jjtClose` in your AST node base class so that they set both start and end line and column for proper node bound highlighting.
*   _Not strictly required but trivial and useful:_ implement syntax highlighting for Rule Designer:
    *   Fork and clone the [pmd/pmd-designer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer) repository.
    *   Add a syntax highlighter implementation to `net.sourceforge.pmd.util.fxdesigner.util.codearea.syntaxhighlighting` (you could use Java as an example).
    *   Register it in the `AvailableSyntaxHighlighters` enumeration.
    *   Now build your implementation and place the `target/pmd-designer-<version>-SNAPSHOT.jar` to the `lib` directory inside your `pmd-bin-...` distribution (you have to delete old `pmd-designer-*.jar` from there).

## Optional features

### Metrics

If you want to add support for computing metrics:
* Create a package `lang.<langname>.metrics`
* Create a utility class `<langname>Metrics`
* Implement new metrics and add them as static constants. Be sure to document them.
* Implement {% jdoc core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler#getLanguageMetricsProvider() %}, to make the metrics available in the designer.

See {% jdoc java::lang.java.metrics.JavaMetrics %} for an example.

### Symbol table

A symbol table keeps track of variables and their usages. It is part of semantic analysis and would
be executed in your parser adapter as an additional pass after you got the initial AST.

There is no general language independent API in PMD core. For now, each language will need to implement
its own solution. The symbol information that has been resolved in the additional parser pass
can be made available on the AST nodes via extra methods, e.g. `getSymbolTable()`, `getSymbol()`, or
`getUsages()`.

Currently only Java provides an implementation for symbol table,
see [Java-specific features and guidance](pmd_languages_java.html).

{% capture deprecated_symbols_api_note %}
With PMD 7.0.0 the symbol table and type resolution implementation has been
rewritten from scratch. There is still an old API for symbol table support, that is used by PLSQL,
see {% jdoc_package core::lang.symboltable %}. This will be deprecated and should not be used.
{% endcapture %}
{% include note.html content=deprecated_symbols_api_note %}

### Type resolution

For typed languages like Java type information can be useful for writing rules, that trigger only on
specific types. Resolving types of expressions and variables would be done after in your parser
adapter as yet another additional pass, potentially after resolving the symbol table.

Type resolution tries to find the actual class type of each used type, following along method calls
(including overloaded and overwritten methods), allowing to query subtypes and type hierarchy.
This might require additional configuration for the language, e.g. in Java you need
to configure an auxiliary classpath.

There is no general language independent API in PMD core. For now, each language will need to implement
its own solution. The type information can be made available on the AST nodes via extra methods,
e.g. `getType()`.

Currently only Java provides an implementation for type resolution,
see [Java-specific features and guidance](pmd_languages_java.html).

### Call and data flow analysis

Call and data flow analysis keep track of the data as it is moving through different execution paths
a program has. This would be yet another analysis pass.

There is no general language independent API in PMD core. For now, each language will need to implement
its own solution.

Currently Java has some limited support for data flow analysis,
see [Java-specific features and guidance](pmd_languages_java.html).
