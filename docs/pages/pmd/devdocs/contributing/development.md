## Continuous Integration

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/actions) as our ci service. The main repo and the eclipse plugin are built for
every push. Each pull request is built as well.

The maven snapshot artifacts are deployed at [Sonatypes OSS snapshot repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/sourceforge/pmd/pmd/).

Ready-to-use binary packages are uploaded to sourceforge at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd/>.

## Documentation and Webpages

Main documentation server is [docs.pmd-code.org](https://docs.pmd-code.org).

A [snapshot](http://docs.pmd-code.org/snapshot/) of the web site for the new version is generated by the ci job as well.

The latest release documentation is always available under [docs.pmd-code.org/latest](https://docs.pmd-code.org/latest/)
