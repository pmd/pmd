There are numerous ways of getting help:

*   Search for already existing questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

*   If you can't find your problem, post a new question. Don't forget to tag the question with [`pmd`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pmd).

*   If you found a bug, please create a new [github issue](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues).

*   You can also ask questions on [github discussions](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/discussions).

*   Or you can join the [Mailing List](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pmd-devel) or browse
    through the [mailing list archive](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/mailman/pmd-devel/).

*   Ask your question in our [Gitter room](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#pmd_pmd:gitter.im).

*   Ask your question our [PMD Guru at Gurubase](https://gurubase.io/g/pmd).

*   Of course, you can also directly jump to our [source code on github](https://github.com/pmd/pmd).
