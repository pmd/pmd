The [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is dynamically typed, like a scripting language,
and has good support for interactive use. 
Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance.
Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.

## Support in PMD
Starting from version 7.0.0, Julia support was added to CPD.

### Limitations
- Support for Julia only extends to CPD to detect code duplication in Julia source files.
