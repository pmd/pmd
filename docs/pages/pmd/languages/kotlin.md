Kotlin support in PMD is based on the official grammar from <https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-spec>.

Java-based rules and XPath-based rules are supported.

{% include note.html content="Kotlin support has **experimental** stability level, meaning no compatibility should
be expected between even incremental releases. Any functionality can be added, removed or changed without
warning." %}
