### New and noteworthy

#### Improved Incremental Analysis

[Incremental Analysis](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.36.0/pmd_userdocs_incremental_analysis.html) has long helped
our users obtain faster analysis results, however, its implementation tended to be too cautious in detecting
changes to the runtime and type resolution classpaths, producing more cache invalidations than necessary.
We have now improved the heuristics to remove several bogus invalidations, and slightly sped up the cache
usage along the way.

PMD will now ignore:

*   Non class files in classpath and jar / zip files being referenced.
*   Changes to the order of file entries within a jar / zip
*   Changes to file metadata within jar / zip (ie: creation and modification time,
    significant in multi-module / composite build projects where lateral artifacts are frequently recreated)

#### New rules

*   The new Apex rule [`AvoidDebugStatements`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.36.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#avoiddebugstatements) finds usages of `System.debug` calls.
    Debug statements contribute to longer transactions and consume Apex CPU time even when debug logs are not
    being captured.
    You can try out this rule like so:

```xml
    <rule ref="category/apex/performance.xml/AvoidDebugStatements" />
```

*   The new Apex rule [`InaccessibleAuraEnabledGetter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.36.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#inaccessibleauraenabledgetter) checks that an `AuraEnabled`
    getter is public or global. This is necessary if it is referenced in Lightning components.
    You can try out this rule like so:

```xml
    <rule ref="category/apex/errorprone.xml/InaccessibleAuraEnabledGetter" />
```

#### Renamed rules

*   The Java rule [`BadComparison`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.36.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#badcomparison) has been renamed to
    [`ComparisonWithNaN`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.36.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#comparisonwithnan) to better reflect what the rule actually detects.
    It now considers usages of `Double.NaN` or `Float.NaN` in more cases and fixes false negatives.

### New and noteworthy

#### Javascript module now requires at least Java 8

The latest version of [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino), the implementation of JavaScript we use
for parsing JavaScript code, requires at least Java 8. Therefore we decided to upgrade the pmd-javascript
module to Java 8 as well. This means that from now on, a Java 8 or later runtime is required in order
to analyze JavaScript code. Note that PMD core still only requires Java 7.

#### New rules

This release ships with 3 new Java rules.

*   [`JUnit5TestShouldBePackagePrivate`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junit5testshouldbepackageprivate)
    enforces the convention that JUnit 5 tests should have minimal visibility.
    You can try out this rule like so:
```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/bestpractices.xml/JUnit5TestShouldBePackagePrivate" />
```

*   [`CognitiveComplexity`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#cognitivecomplexity) uses the cognitive complexity
    metric to find overly complex code. This metric improves on the similar cyclomatic complexity 
    in several ways, for instance, it incentivizes using clearly readable shorthands and idioms.
    See the rule documentation for more details. You can try out this rule like so:
```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/design.xml/CognitiveComplexity" />
```

*   [`MutableStaticState`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#mutablestaticstate) finds non-private static fields
    that are not final. These fields break encapsulation since these fields can be modified from anywhere
    within the program. You can try out this rule like so:
```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/design.xml/MutableStaticState" />
```

#### Modified rules

*   The Java rule [`CompareObjectsWithEquals`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#compareobjectswithequals) has now a new property
    `typesThatCompareByReference`. With that property, you can configure types, that should be whitelisted
    for comparison by reference. By default, `java.lang.Enum` and `java.lang.Class` are allowed, but
    you could add custom types here.
    Additionally comparisons against constants are allowed now. This makes the rule less noisy when two constants
    are compared. Constants are identified by looking for an all-caps identifier.

#### Deprecated rules

*   The java rule [`DefaultPackage`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#defaultpackage) has been deprecated in favor of
    [`CommentDefaultAccessModifier`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#commentdefaultaccessmodifier).

    The rule "DefaultPackage" assumes that any usage of package-access is accidental,
    and by doing so, prohibits using a really fundamental and useful feature of the language.

    To satisfy the rule, you have to make the member public even if it doesn't need to, or make it protected,
    which muddies your intent even more if you don't intend the class to be extended, and may be at odds with
    other rules like [`AvoidProtectedFieldInFinalClass`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#avoidprotectedfieldinfinalclass).

    The rule [`CommentDefaultAccessModifier`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#commentdefaultaccessmodifier) should be used instead.
    It flags the same thing, but has an escape hatch.

*   The Java rule [`CloneThrowsCloneNotSupportedException`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.35.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#clonethrowsclonenotsupportedexception) has been deprecated without
    replacement.

    The rule has no real value as `CloneNotSupportedException` is a
    checked exception and therefore you need to deal with it while implementing the `clone()` method. You either
    need to declare the exception or catch it. If you catch it, then subclasses can't throw it themselves explicitly.
    However, `Object.clone()` will still throw this exception if the `Cloneable` interface is not implemented.

    Note, this rule has also been removed from the Quickstart Ruleset (`rulesets/java/quickstart.xml`).

### New and noteworthy

#### New rules

*   The new Java rule [`UseStandardCharsets`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#usestandardcharsets) finds usages of `Charset.forName`,
    where `StandardCharsets` can be used instead.

    This rule is also part of the Quickstart Ruleset (`rulesets/java/quickstart.xml`) for Java.

*   The new Java rule [`UnnecessaryImport`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryimport) replaces the rules
    [`UnusedImports`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedimports), [`DuplicateImports`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#duplicateimports),
    [`ImportFromSamePackage`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#importfromsamepackage), and [`DontImportJavaLang`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#dontimportjavalang).

    This rule is also part of the Quickstart Ruleset (`rulesets/java/quickstart.xml`) for Java.

#### Modified rules

*   The Apex rule [`ApexCRUDViolation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_apex_security.html#apexcrudviolation) does not ignore getters anymore and also flags
    SOQL/SOSL/DML operations without access permission checks in getters. This will produce false positives now for
    VF getter methods, but we can't reliably detect, whether a getter is a VF getter or not. In such cases,
    the violation should be [suppressed](pmd_userdocs_suppressing_warnings.html).

#### Deprecated rules

*   java-bestpractices
    *   [`UnusedImports`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedimports): use the rule [`UnnecessaryImport`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryimport) instead

*   java-codestyle
    *   [`DuplicateImports`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#duplicateimports): use the rule [`UnnecessaryImport`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryimport) instead

*   java-errorprone
    *   [`ImportFromSamePackage`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#importfromsamepackage): use the rule [`UnnecessaryImport`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.34.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryimport) instead

### New and noteworthy

#### PLSQL parsing exclusions

The PMD PLSQL parser might not parse every valid PL/SQL code without problems.
In order to still use PMD on such files, you can now mark certain lines for exclusion from
the parser. More information can be found in the [language specific documentation for PLSQL](pmd_languages_plsql.html).

### New and noteworthy

#### Java 16 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 16. PMD supports [JEP 394: Pattern Matching for instanceof](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/394) and [JEP 395: Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395). Both have been promoted
to be a standard language feature of Java 16.

PMD also supports [JEP 397: Sealed Classes (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/397) as a preview
language feature. In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable
it via the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language version `16-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd -language java -version 16-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 14 preview language features have been removed. The version "14-preview" is no longer available.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Apex rule [`ApexDoc`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.32.0/pmd_rules_apex_documentation.html#apexdoc) has two new properties: `reportPrivate` and
    `reportProtected`. Previously the rule only considered public and global classes, methods, and
    properties. With these properties, you can verify the existence of ApexDoc comments for private
    and protected methods as well. By default, these properties are disabled to preserve backwards
    compatible behavior.

### Fixed Issues

*   apex-documentation
    *   [#3075](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3075): \[apex] ApexDoc should support private access modifier

### API Changes

#### Experimental APIs

*   The experimental class `ASTTypeTestPattern` has been renamed to <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.32.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTTypePattern.html#"><code>ASTTypePattern</code></a>
    in order to align the naming to the JLS.
*   The experimental class `ASTRecordConstructorDeclaration` has been renamed to <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.32.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTCompactConstructorDeclaration.html#"><code>ASTCompactConstructorDeclaration</code></a>
    in order to align the naming to the JLS.
*   The AST types and APIs around Pattern Matching and Records are not experimental anymore:
    *   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.32.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTVariableDeclaratorId.html#isPatternBinding()"><code>ASTVariableDeclaratorId#isPatternBinding</code></a>

#### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   The protected or public member of the Java rule <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.32.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/bestpractices/AvoidUsingHardCodedIPRule.html#"><code>AvoidUsingHardCodedIPRule</code></a>
    are deprecated and considered to be internal API. They will be removed with PMD 7.

### New and noteworthy

#### SARIF Format

PMD now supports the [Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sarif)
as an additional report format. Just use the [command line parameter](pmd_userdocs_cli_reference.html#format) `-format sarif` to select it.
SARIF is an OASIS standard format for static analysis tools.
PMD creates SARIF JSON files in [SARIF version 2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html).
An example report can be found in the documentation in [Report formats for PMD](pmd_userdocs_report_formats.html#sarif).

#### CPD

*   The C++ module now supports the new option [`--ignore-literal-sequences`](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#-ignore-literal-sequences),
    which can be used to avoid detection of some uninteresting clones. This options has been
    introduced with PMD 6.30.0 for C# and is now available for C++ as well. See [#2963](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2963).

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#overridebothequalsandhashcode) brings the well known Java rule
    to Apex. In Apex the same principle applies: `equals` and `hashCode` should always be overridden
    together to ensure collection classes such as Maps and Sets work as expected.

*   The new Visualforce rule [`VfHtmlStyleTagXss`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_vf_security.html#vfhtmlstyletagxss) checks for potential XSS problems
    when using `<style>` tags on Visualforce pages.

#### Deprecated rules

*   java-performance
    *   [`AvoidUsingShortType`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#avoidusingshorttype): arithmetic on shorts is not significantly
        slower than on ints, whereas using shorts may provide significant memory savings in arrays.
    *   [`SimplifyStartsWith`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.31.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#simplifystartswith): the suggested code transformation has an
        insignificant performance impact, and decreases readability.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated API

*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-xml/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/xml/rule/AbstractDomXmlRule.html#"><code>AbstractDomXmlRule</code></a>
*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-xml/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/wsdl/rule/AbstractWsdlRule.html#"><code>AbstractWsdlRule</code></a>
*   A few methods of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-xml/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/xml/rule/AbstractXmlRule.html#"><code>AbstractXmlRule</code></a>

#### Experimental APIs

*   The method <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/GenericToken.html#getKind()"><code>GenericToken#getKind</code></a> has been added as experimental. This
    unifies the token interface for both JavaCC and Antlr. The already existing method
    <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.31.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/cpd/token/AntlrToken.html#getKind()"><code>AntlrToken#getKind</code></a> is therefore experimental as well. The
    returned constant depends on the actual language and might change whenever the grammar
    of the language is changed.

##### CPD

* The C# module now supports the new option [`--ignore-literal-sequences`](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#-ignore-literal-sequences), which can be used to avoid detection of some uninteresting clones. Support for other languages may be added in the future. See [#2945](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2945)

* The Scala module now supports [suppression](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression) through `CPD-ON`/`CPD-OFF` comment pairs. See [#2929](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2929)


##### Type information for VisualForce

The Visualforce AST now can resolve the data type of Visualforce expressions that reference Apex Controller properties and Custom Object fields. This feature improves the precision of existing rules, like [`VfUnescapeEl`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.30.0/pmd_rules_vf_security.html#vfunescapeel).

This can be configured using two environment variables:
* `PMD_VF_APEXDIRECTORIES`: Comma separated list of directories for Apex classes. Absolute or relative to the Visualforce directory. Default is `../classes`. Specifying an empty string will disable data type resolution for Apex Controller properties.
* `PMD_VF_OBJECTSDIRECTORIES`: Comma separated list of directories for Custom Objects. Absolute or relative to the Visualforce directory. Default is `../objects`. Specifying an empty string will disable data type resolution for Custom Object fields.

This feature is experimental, in particular, expect changes to the way the configuration is specified. We'll probably extend the CLI instead of relying on environment variables in a future version.

Thanks to Jeff Bartolotta and Roopa Mohan for contributing this!

### API Changes

#### Deprecated API


##### Around RuleSet parsing

* <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetFactory.html#"><code>RuleSetFactory</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RulesetsFactoryUtils.html#"><code>RulesetsFactoryUtils</code></a> have been deprecated in favor of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetLoader.html#"><code>RuleSetLoader</code></a>. This is easier to configure, and more maintainable than the multiple overloads of `RulesetsFactoryUtils`.
* Some static creation methods have been added to <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#"><code>RuleSet</code></a> for simple cases, eg <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#forSingleRule(net.sourceforge.pmd.Rule)"><code>forSingleRule</code></a>. These replace some counterparts in <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetFactory.html#"><code>RuleSetFactory</code></a>
* Since <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSets.html#"><code>RuleSets</code></a> is also deprecated, many APIs that require a RuleSets instance now are deprecated, and have a counterpart that expects a `List<RuleSet>`.
* <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetReferenceId.html#"><code>RuleSetReferenceId</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetReference.html#"><code>RuleSetReference</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetFactoryCompatibility.html#"><code>RuleSetFactoryCompatibility</code></a> are deprecated. They are most likely not relevant outside of the implementation of pmd-core.

##### Around the `PMD` class

Many classes around PMD's entry point (<a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/PMD.html#"><code>PMD</code></a>) have been deprecated as internal, including:
* The contents of the packages <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/cli/package-summary.html#"><code>net.sourceforge.pmd.cli</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/processor/package-summary.html#"><code>net.sourceforge.pmd.processor</code></a>
* <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/SourceCodeProcessor.html#"><code>SourceCodeProcessor</code></a>
* The constructors of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/PMD.html#"><code>PMD</code></a> (the class will be made a utility class)

##### Miscellaneous

*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTPackageDeclaration.html#getPackageNameImage()"><code>ASTPackageDeclaration#getPackageNameImage</code></a>,

    and the corresponding XPath attributes. In both cases they're replaced with a new method `getName`,
    the attribute is `@Name`.
*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-java/6.30.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTClassOrInterfaceBody.html#isAnonymousInnerClass()"><code>ASTClassOrInterfaceBody#isAnonymousInnerClass</code></a>,

### New and noteworthy

#### Updated Apex Support

*   The Apex language support has been bumped to version 50 (Winter '21). All new language features are now properly
    parsed and processed. Especially the [Safe Navigation Operator](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/rn_apex_SafeNavigationOperator.htm) is now supported.
    See also [Salesforce Winter '21 Release Notes](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/rn_apex.htm)

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`OperationWithLimitsInLoop`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#operationwithlimitsinloop) (`apex-performance`)
    finds operations in loops that may hit governor limits such as DML operations, SOQL
    queries and more. The rule replaces the three rules "AvoidDmlStatementsInLoops", "AvoidSoqlInLoops",
    and "AvoidSoslInLoops".

#### Renamed Rules

*   The Java rule [`DoNotCallSystemExit`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#donotcallsystemexit) has been renamed to
    [`DoNotTerminateVM`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#donotterminatevm), since it checks for all the following calls:
    `System.exit(int)`, `Runtime.exit(int)`, `Runtime.halt(int)`. All these calls terminate
    the Java VM, which is bad, if the VM runs an application server which many independent applications.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Apex rules [`AvoidDmlStatementsInLoops`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#avoiddmlstatementsinloops),
    [`AvoidSoqlInLoops`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#avoidsoqlinloops) and [`AvoidSoslInLoops`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#avoidsoslinloops)
    (`apex-performance`) are deprecated in favour of the new rule
    [`OperationWithLimitsInLoop`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#operationwithlimitsinloop). The deprecated rules will be removed
    with PMD 7.0.0.

### New and noteworthy

#### CPD's AnyTokenizer has been improved

The AnyTokenizer is used for languages, that don't have an own lexer/grammar based tokenizer.
AnyTokenizer now handles string literals and end-of-line comments. Fortran, Perl and Ruby have
been updated to use AnyTokenizer instead of their old custom tokenizer based on AbstractTokenizer.
See [#2758](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2758) for details.

AbstractTokenizer and the custom tokenizers of Fortran, Perl and Ruby are deprecated now.

### New and noteworthy

#### Java 15 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 15. PMD can parse [Text Blocks](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378)
which have been promoted to be a standard language feature of Java.

PMD also supports [Pattern Matching for instanceof](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/375),
[Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384), and [Sealed Classes](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360).

Note: The Pattern Matching for instanceof, Records, and Sealed Classes are all preview language features of OpenJDK 15
and are not enabled by default. In order to
analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable it via the environment
variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language version `15-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd -language java -version 15-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 13 preview language features have been removed. The version "13-preview" is no longer available.

#### Changes in how tab characters are handled

In the past, tab characters in source files has been handled differently in different languages by PMD.
For instance in Java, tab characters had a width of 8 columns, while C# used only 1 column. Visualforce instead
used 4 columns.

This has been unified now so that tab characters are consistently now always 1 column wide.

This however might be a **incompatible** change, if you're using the properties "BeginColumn" or "EndColumn"
additionally to "BeginLine" and "EndLine" of a Token/AST node in order to highlight
where a rule violation occurred in the source file. If you have logic there that deals with tab characters,
you most likely can remove this logic now, since tab characters are now just "normal" characters
in terms of string processing.

See also [[all] Ensure PMD/CPD uses tab width of 1 for tabs consistently #2656](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2656).

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.27.0).

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`AvoidReassigningCatchVariables`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.27.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#avoidreassigningcatchvariables) (`java-bestpractices`) finds
    cases where the variable of the caught exception is reassigned. This practice is surprising and prevents
    further evolution of the code like multi-catch.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`CloseResource`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.27.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#closeresource) (`java-errorprone`) has a new property
    `closeNotInFinally`. With this property set to `true` the rule will also find calls to close a
    resource, which are not in a finally-block of a try-statement. If a resource is not closed within a
    finally block, it might not be closed at all in case of exceptions.
    
    As this new detection would yield many new violations, it is disabled by default. It might be
    enabled in a later version of PMD.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule [`DataflowAnomalyAnalysis`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.27.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#dataflowanomalyanalysis) (`java-errorprone`)
    is deprecated in favour of [`UnusedAssignment`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.27.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedassignment) (`java-bestpractices`),
    which was introduced in PMD 6.26.0.

### API Changes

*   XML rule definition in rulesets: In PMD 7, the `language` attribute will be required on all `rule`
    elements that declare a new rule. Some base rule classes set the language implicitly in their
    constructor, and so this is not required in all cases for the rule to work. But this
    behavior will be discontinued in PMD 7, so missing `language` attributes are now
    reported as a forward compatibility warning.

### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`UnusedAssignment`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.26.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedassignment) (`java-bestpractices`) finds assignments
    to variables, that are never used and are useless. The new rule is supposed to entirely replace
    [`DataflowAnomalyAnalysis`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.26.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#dataflowanomalyanalysis).

#### Modified rules

*   The Java rule [`ArrayIsStoredDirectly`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.26.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#arrayisstoreddirectly) (`java-bestpractices`) now ignores
    by default private methods and constructors. You can restore the old behavior by setting the new property
    `allowPrivate` to "false".

### New and noteworthy

#### Scala cross compilation

Up until now the PMD Scala module has been compiled against scala 2.13 only by default.
However, this makes it impossible to use pmd as a library in scala projects,
that use scala 2.12, e.g. in sbt plugins. Therefore PMD now provides cross compiled pmd-scala
modules for both versions: **scala 2.12** and **scala 2.13**.

The new modules have new maven artifactIds. The old artifactId `net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-scala:6.25.0`
is still available, but is deprecated from now on. It has been demoted to be just a delegation to the new
`pmd-scala_2.13` module and will be removed eventually.

The coordinates for the new modules are:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
    <artifactId>pmd-scala_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>6.25.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
    <artifactId>pmd-scala_2.13</artifactId>
    <version>6.25.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The command line version of PMD continues to use **scala 2.13**.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java Rule [`UnnecessaryCast`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.25.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessarycast) (`java-codestyle`)
    finds casts that are unnecessary while accessing collection elements.

*   The new Java Rule [`AvoidCalendarDateCreation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.25.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#avoidcalendardatecreation) (`java-performance`)
    finds usages of `java.util.Calendar` whose purpose is just to get the current date. This
    can be done in a more lightweight way.

*   The new Java Rule [`UseIOStreamsWithApacheCommonsFileItem`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.25.0/pmd_rules_java_performance.html#useiostreamswithapachecommonsfileitem) (`java-performance`)
    finds usage of `FileItem.get()` and `FileItem.getString()`. These two methods are problematic since
    they load the whole uploaded file into memory.

#### Modified rules

*   The Java rule [`UseDiamondOperator`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.25.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#usediamondoperator) (`java-codestyle`) now by default
    finds unnecessary usages of type parameters, which are nested, involve wildcards and are used
    within a ternary operator. These usages are usually only unnecessary with Java8 and later, when
    the type inference in Java has been improved.
    
    In order to avoid false positives when checking Java7 only code, the rule has the new property
    `java7Compatibility`, which is disabled by default. Settings this to "true" retains
    the old rule behaviour.

### Fixed Issues

*   apex-bestpractices
    *   [#2554](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2554): \[apex] Exception applying rule UnusedLocalVariable on trigger

    or `net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-scala_2.12` instead.

*   Rule implementation classes are internal API and should not be used by clients directly.
    The rules should only be referenced via their entry in the corresponding category ruleset
    (e.g. `<rule ref="category/java/bestpractices.xml/AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod" />`).
    
    While we definitely won't move or rename the rule classes in PMD 6.x, we might consider changes
    in PMD 7.0.0 and onwards.

#### Deprecated APIs

##### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

### New and noteworthy

#### CPD now supports XML as well

Thanks to [Fernando Cosso](https://github.com/xnYi9wRezm) CPD can now find duplicates in XML files as well.
This is useful to find duplicated sections in XML files.

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.24.0).

#### New Rules

*   The new Java Rule [`LiteralsFirstInComparisons`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.24.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#literalsfirstincomparisons) (`java-bestpractices`)
    find String literals, that are used in comparisons and are not positioned first. Using the String literal
    as the receiver of e.g. `equals` helps to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
    
    This rule is replacing the two old rules [`PositionLiteralsFirstInComparisons`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.24.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#positionliteralsfirstincomparisons)
    and [`PositionLiteralsFirstInCaseInsensitiveComparisons`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.24.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#positionliteralsfirstincaseinsensitivecomparisons) and extends the check
    for the methods `compareTo`, `compareToIgnoreCase` and `contentEquals` in addition to `equals` and
    `equalsIgnoreCase`.
    
    Note: This rule also replaces the two mentioned rules in Java's quickstart ruleset.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The two Java rules [`PositionLiteralsFirstInComparisons`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.24.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#positionliteralsfirstincomparisons)
    and [`PositionLiteralsFirstInCaseInsensitiveComparisons`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.24.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#positionliteralsfirstincaseinsensitivecomparisons) have been deprecated
    in favor of the new rule [`LiteralsFirstInComparisons`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.24.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#literalsfirstincomparisons).

### New and noteworthy

#### PMD adopts Contributor Code of Conduct

To facilitate healthy and constructive community behavior PMD adopts
[Contributor Convenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its code of
conduct.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

You can find the code of conduct in the file [code_of_conduct.md](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
in our repository.

#### Performance improvements for XPath 2.0 rules

XPath rules written with XPath 2.0 now support conversion to a rulechain rule, which
improves their performance. The rulechain is a mechanism that allows several rules
to be executed in a single tree traversal. Conversion to the rulechain is possible if
your XPath expression looks like `//someNode/... | //someOtherNode/...  | ...`, that
is, a union of one or more path expressions that start with `//`. Instead of traversing
the whole tree once per path expression (and per rule), a single traversal executes all
rules in your ruleset as needed.

This conversion is performed automatically and cannot be disabled. *The conversion should
not change the result of your rules*, if it does, please report a bug at https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues

Note that XPath 1.0 support, the default XPath version, is deprecated since PMD 6.22.0.
**We highly recommend that you upgrade your rules to XPath 2.0**. Please refer to the [migration guide](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_xpath_rules.html#migrating-from-10-to-20).

#### Javascript improvements for ES6

PMD uses the [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino) library to parse Javascript.
The default version has been set to `ES6`, so that some ECMAScript 2015 features are
supported. E.g. `let` statements and `for-of` loops are now parsed. However Rhino does
not support all features.

#### New JSON renderer

PMD now supports a JSON renderer (use it with `-f json` on the CLI).
See [the documentation and example](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_report_formats.html#json)

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStart`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.23.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#fielddeclarationsshouldbeatstart) (`apex-codestyle`)
    helps to ensure that field declarations are always at the beginning of a class.

*   The new Apex rule [`UnusedLocalVariable`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.23.0/pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#unusedlocalvariable) (`apex-bestpractices`) detects unused
    local variables.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

##### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/xpath/AbstractXPathRuleQuery.html#"><code>AbstractXPathRuleQuery</code></a>
*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/xpath/JaxenXPathRuleQuery.html#"><code>JaxenXPathRuleQuery</code></a>
*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/xpath/SaxonXPathRuleQuery.html#"><code>SaxonXPathRuleQuery</code></a>
*   <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/xpath/XPathRuleQuery.html#"><code>XPathRuleQuery</code></a>

##### In ASTs

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated in the **Apex**, **Javascript**, **PL/SQL**, **Scala** and **Visualforce** ASTs:

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/annotation/InternalApi.html#"><code>InternalApi</code></a>. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,
    which for rules, means that they never need to instantiate node themselves.
    Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
    *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-visualforce/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vf/ast/VfNode.html#"><code>VfNode</code></a> or
        <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/Node.html#"><code>Node</code></a>, or the other published interfaces in this package,
        to refer to nodes generically.
    *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The implementation classes of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/Parser.html#"><code>Parser</code></a> (eg <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-visualforce/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vf/VfParser.html#"><code>VfParser</code></a>) are deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/LanguageVersionHandler.html#getParser(ParserOptions)"><code>LanguageVersionHandler#getParser</code></a> instead.
*   The implementation classes of <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/TokenManager.html#"><code>TokenManager</code></a> (eg <a href="https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-visualforce/6.23.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vf/VfTokenManager.html#"><code>VfTokenManager</code></a>) are deprecated and should not be used outside of our implementation.
    **This also affects CPD-only modules**.

These deprecations are added to the following language modules in this release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Java 14 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 14. PMD can parse [Switch Expressions](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361),
which have been promoted to be a standard language feature of Java.

PMD also parses [Text Blocks](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/368) as String literals, which is still a preview
language feature in Java 14.

The new [Pattern Matching for instanceof](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305) can be used as well as
[Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359).

Note: The Text Blocks, Pattern Matching for instanceof and Records are all preview language features of OpenJDK 14
and are not enabled by default. In order to
analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable it via the environment
variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language version `14-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd -language java -version 14-preview ...

Note: Support for the extended break statement introduced in Java 12 as a preview language feature
has been removed from PMD with this version. The version "12-preview" is no longer available.


#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.21.0).

#### Apex Suppressions

In addition to suppressing violation with the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation, Apex now also supports
the suppressions with a `NOPMD` comment. See [Suppressing warnings](pmd_userdocs_suppressing_warnings.html).

#### Improved CPD support for C#

The C# tokenizer is now based on an antlr grammar instead of a manual written tokenizer. This
should give more accurate results and especially fixes the problems with the using statement syntax
(see [#2139](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2139)).

#### XPath Rules

See the new documentation about [Writing XPath Rules](pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_xpath_rules.html).

*Note:* As of PMD version 6.22.0, XPath versions 1.0 and the 1.0 compatibility mode are **deprecated**.
XPath 2.0 is superior in many ways, for example for its support for type checking, sequence values,
or quantified expressions. For a detailed but approachable review of the features of XPath 2.0 and above,
see the [Saxon documentation](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!expressions).

#### New Rules

*   The Rule [`CognitiveComplexity`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.22.0/pmd_rules_apex_design.html#cognitivecomplexity) (`apex-design`) finds methods and classes
    that are highly complex and therefore difficult to read and more costly to maintain. In contrast
    to cyclomatic complexity, this rule uses "Cognitive Complexity", which is a measure of how
    difficult it is for humans to read and understand a method.

*   The Rule [`TestMethodsMustBeInTestClasses`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.22.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#testmethodsmustbeintestclasses) (`apex-errorprone`) finds test methods
    that are not residing in a test class. The test methods should be moved to a proper test class.
    Support for tests inside functional classes was removed in Spring-13 (API Version 27.0), making classes
    that violate this rule fail compile-time. This rule is however useful when dealing with legacy code.

##### In ASTs (JSP)

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the JSP AST** (with other languages to come):

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/annotation/InternalApi.html#"><code>InternalApi</code></a>. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,
    which for rules, means that they never need to instantiate node themselves.
    Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
    *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-jsp/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/jsp/ast/JspNode.html#"><code>JspNode</code></a> or
        <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/Node.html#"><code>Node</code></a>, or the other published interfaces in this package,
        to refer to nodes generically.
    *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The class <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-jsp/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/jsp/JspParser.html#"><code>JspParser</code></a> is deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/LanguageVersionHandler.html#getParser(ParserOptions)"><code>LanguageVersionHandler#getParser</code></a> instead.

##### In ASTs (Velocity)

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the VM AST** (with other languages to come):

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/annotation/InternalApi.html#"><code>InternalApi</code></a>. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,

*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
    *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-vm/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vm/ast/VmNode.html#"><code>VmNode</code></a> or

    *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The package <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-vm/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vm/directive/package-summary.html#"><code>net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.vm.directive</code></a> as well as the classes
    <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-vm/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vm/util/DirectiveMapper.html#"><code>DirectiveMapper</code></a> and <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-vm/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vm/util/LogUtil.html#"><code>LogUtil</code></a> are deprecated
    for removal. They were only used internally during parsing.
*   The class <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-vm/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/vm/VmParser.html#"><code>VmParser</code></a> is deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use <a href="https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.22.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/LanguageVersionHandler.html#getParser(ParserOptions)"><code>LanguageVersionHandler#getParser</code></a> instead.

#### PLSQL AST

The production and node `ASTCursorBody` was unnecessary, not used and has been removed. Cursors have been already
parsed as `ASTCursorSpecification`.

### New and noteworthy

#### Modelica support

Thanks to [Anatoly Trosinenko](https://github.com/atrosinenko) PMD supports now a new language:
[Modelica](https://modelica.org/modelicalanguage) is a language to model complex physical systems.
Both PMD and CPD are supported and there are already [3 rules available](pmd_rules_modelica.html).
The PMD Designer supports syntax highlighting for Modelica.

While the language implementation is quite complete, Modelica support is considered experimental
for now. This is to allow us to change the rule API (e.g. the AST classes) slightly and improve
the implementation based on your feedback.

#### Simple XML dump of AST

We added a experimental feature to dump the AST of a source file into XML. The XML format
is of course PMD specific and language dependent. That XML file can be used to execute
(XPath) queries against without PMD. It can also be used as a textual visualization of the AST
if you don't want to use the [Designer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer).

This feature is experimental and might change or even be removed in the future, if it is not
useful. A short description how to use it is available under [Creating XML dump of the AST](pmd_devdocs_experimental_ast_dump.html).

Any feedback about it, especially about your use cases, is highly appreciated.

#### Updated Apex Support

*   The Apex language support has been bumped to version 48 (Spring '20). All new language features are now properly
    parsed and processed.

#### CPD XML format

The CPD XML output format has been enhanced to also report column information for found duplications
in addition to the line information. This allows to display the exact tokens, that are considered
duplicate.

If a CPD language doesn't provide these exact information, then these additional attributes are omitted.

Each `<file>` element in the XML format now has 3 new attributes:

*   attribute `endline`
*   attribute `column` (if there is column information available)
*   attribute `endcolumn` (if there is column information available)

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`AvoidLiteralsInIfCondition`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.21.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#avoidliteralsinifcondition) (`java-errorprone`) has a new property
    `ignoreExpressions`. This property is set by default to `true` in order to maintain compatibility. If this
    property is set to false, then literals in more complex expressions are considered as well.

*   The Apex rule [`ApexCSRF`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.21.0/pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#apexcsrf) (`apex-errorprone`) has been moved from category
    "Security" to "Error Prone". The Apex runtime already prevents DML statements from being executed, but only
    at runtime. So, if you try to do this, you'll get an error at runtime, hence this is error prone. See also
    the discussion on [#2064](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2064).

*   The Java rule [`CommentRequired`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.21.0/pmd_rules_java_documentation.html#commentrequired) (`java-documentation`) has a new property
    `classCommentRequirement`. This replaces the now deprecated property `headerCommentRequirement`, since
    the name was misleading. (File) header comments are not checked, but class comments are.

### API Changes


#### Deprecated APIs

##### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

* [`JavaLanguageHandler`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/JavaLanguageHandler.html#)
* [`JavaLanguageParser`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/JavaLanguageParser.html#)
* [`JavaDataFlowHandler`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/JavaDataFlowHandler.html#)
* Implementations of [`RuleViolationFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/RuleViolationFactory.html#) in each
  language module, eg [`JavaRuleViolationFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/JavaRuleViolationFactory.html#).
  See javadoc of [`RuleViolationFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/RuleViolationFactory.html#).
* Implementations of [`RuleViolation`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleViolation.html#) in each language module,
  eg [`JavaRuleViolation`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/JavaRuleViolation.html#). See javadoc of
  [`RuleViolation`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleViolation.html#).

* [`RuleFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/rules/RuleFactory.html#)
* [`RuleBuilder`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/rules/RuleBuilder.html#)
* Constructors of [`RuleSetFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSetFactory.html#), use factory methods from [`RulesetsFactoryUtils`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RulesetsFactoryUtils.html#) instead
* [`getRulesetFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RulesetsFactoryUtils.html#getRulesetFactory(net.sourceforge.pmd.PMDConfiguration,net.sourceforge.pmd.util.ResourceLoader))

* [`AbstractApexNode`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-apex/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/ast/AbstractApexNode.html#)
* [`AbstractApexNodeBase`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-apex/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/ast/AbstractApexNodeBase.html#), and the related `visit`
methods on [`ApexParserVisitor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-apex/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/ast/ApexParserVisitor.html#) and its implementations.
 Use [`ApexNode`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-apex/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/ast/ApexNode.html#) instead, now considers comments too.

* [`CharStream`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/CharStream.html#), [`JavaCharStream`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/JavaCharStream.html#),
[`SimpleCharStream`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/SimpleCharStream.html#): these are APIs used by our JavaCC
implementations and that will be moved/refactored for PMD 7.0.0. They should not
be used, extended or implemented directly.
* All classes generated by JavaCC, eg [`JJTJavaParserState`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JJTJavaParserState.html#).
This includes token classes, which will be replaced with a single implementation, and
subclasses of [`ParseException`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/ParseException.html#), whose usages will be replaced
by just that superclass.


##### For removal

      [`ASTMethodOrConstructorDeclaration`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTMethodOrConstructorDeclaration.html#),
      [`ASTLambdaExpression`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTLambdaExpression.html#).
  * [`ASTAnyTypeDeclaration#getImage`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTAnyTypeDeclaration.html#getImage()) will be removed. Please use `getSimpleName()`
    instead. This affects [`ASTAnnotationTypeDeclaration#getImage`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTAnnotationTypeDeclaration.html#getImage()),
    [`ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#getImage`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration.html#getImage()), and

### New and noteworthy

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.19.0).

#### Java Metrics

*   The new metric "Class Fan Out Complexity" has been added. See
    [Java Metrics Documentation](pmd_java_metrics_index.html#class-fan-out-complexity-class_fan_out) for details.


#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rules [`InvalidLogMessageFormat`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#invalidlogmessageformat) and [`MoreThanOneLogger`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#morethanonelogger)
    (`java-errorprone`) now both support [Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/). Note that the
    rule "InvalidSlf4jMessageFormat" has been renamed to "InvalidLogMessageFormat" to reflect the fact, that it now
    supports more than slf4j.

*   The Java rule [`LawOfDemeter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#lawofdemeter) (`java-design`) ignores now also Builders, that are
    not assigned to a local variable, but just directly used within a method call chain. The method, that creates
    the builder needs to end with "Builder", e.g. `newBuilder()` or `initBuilder()` works. This change
    fixes a couple of false positives.

*   The Java rule [`DataflowAnomalyAnalysis`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#dataflowanomalyanalysis) (`java-errorprone`) doesn't check for
    UR anomalies (undefined and then referenced) anymore. These checks were all false-positives, since actual
    UR occurrences would lead to compile errors.

*   The java rule [`DoNotUseThreads`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#donotusethreads) (`java-multithreading`) has been changed
    to not report usages of `java.lang.Runnable` anymore. Just using `Runnable` does not automatically create
    a new thread. While the check for `Runnable` has been removed, the rule now additionally checks for
    usages of `Executors` and `ExecutorService`. Both create new threads, which are not managed by a J2EE
    server.

#### Renamed Rules

*   The Java rule [`InvalidSlf4jMessageFormat`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#invalidslf4jmessageformat) has been renamed to
    [`InvalidLogMessageFormat`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.19.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#invalidlogmessageformat) since it supports now both slf4j and log4j2
    message formats.

### New and noteworthy

#### Java 13 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 13. PMD can parse [Switch Expressions](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/354)
with the new `yield` statement and resolve the type of such an expression.

PMD also parses [Text Blocks](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355) as String literals.

Note: The Switch Expressions and Text Blocks are a preview language feature of OpenJDK 13
and are not enabled by default. In order to
analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable it via the environment
variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language version `13-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd -language java -version 13-preview ...

Note: Support for the extended break statement introduced in Java 12 as a preview language feature
will be removed with the next PMD version 6.19.0.

#### Full support for Scala

Thanks to [Chris Smith](https://github.com/tophersmith) PMD now fully supports Scala. Now rules for analyzing Scala
code can be developed in addition to the Copy-Paste-Detection (CPD) functionality. There are no rules yet, so
contributions are welcome.

Additionally Scala support has been upgraded from 2.12.4 to 2.13.

#### New rule designer documentation

The documentation for the rule designer is now available on the main PMD documentation page:
[Rule Designer Reference](pmd_userdocs_extending_designer_reference.html). Check it out to learn
about the usage and features of the rule designer.

#### New rules

*   The Java rule [`AvoidMessageDigestField`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.18.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#avoidmessagedigestfield) (`java-bestpractices`) detects fields
    of the type `java.security.MessageDigest`. Using a message digest instance as a field would need to be
    synchronized, as it can easily be used by multiple threads. Without synchronization the calculated hash could
    be entirely wrong. Instead of declaring this as a field and synchronize access to use it from multiple threads,
    a new instance should be created when needed. This rule is also active when using java's quickstart ruleset.

*   The Apex rule [`DebugsShouldUseLoggingLevel`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.18.0/pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#debugsshoulduselogginglevel) (`apex-bestpractices`) detects
    usages of `System.debug()` method calls that are used without specifying the log level. Having the log
    level specified provides a cleaner log, and improves readability of it.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`CloseResource`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.18.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#closeresource) (`java-errorprone`) now ignores by default instances
    of `java.util.stream.Stream`. These streams are `AutoCloseable`, but most streams are backed by collections,
    arrays, or generating functions, which require no special resource management. However, there are some exceptions:
    The stream returned by `Files::lines(Path)` is backed by a actual file and needs to be closed. These instances
    won't be found by default by the rule anymore.

### API Changes

#### Changes to Renderer

*   Each renderer has now a new method [`Renderer#setUseShortNames`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/renderers/Renderer.html#setUseShortNames(List)) which
    is used for implementing the "shortnames" CLI option. The method is automatically called by PMD, if this
    CLI option is in use. When rendering filenames to the report, the new helper method
    [`AbstractRenderer#determineFileName`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/renderers/AbstractRenderer.html#determineFileName(String)) should be used. This will change
    the filename to a short name, if the CLI option "shortnames" is used.
    
    Not adjusting custom renderers will make them render always the full file names and not honoring the
    CLI option "shortnames".

#### Deprecated APIs

##### For removal

*   The methods [`getImportedNameNode`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTImportDeclaration.html#getImportedNameNode()) and
    [`getPackage`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTImportDeclaration.html#getPackage()) have been deprecated and
    will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.
*   The method [`RuleContext#setSourceCodeFilename`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleContext.html#setSourceCodeFilename(String)) has been deprecated
    and will be removed. The already existing method [`RuleContext#setSourceCodeFile`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleContext.html#setSourceCodeFile(File))
    should be used instead. The method [`RuleContext#getSourceCodeFilename`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleContext.html#getSourceCodeFilename()) still
    exists and returns just the filename without the full path.
*   The method [`AbstractPMDProcessor#filenameFrom`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/processor/AbstractPMDProcessor.html#filenameFrom(DataSource)) has been
    deprecated. It was used to determine a "short name" of the file being analyzed, so that the report
    can use short names. However, this logic has been moved to the renderers.
*   The method [`Report#metrics`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#metrics()) and [`Report`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#) have
    been deprecated. They were leftovers from a previous deprecation round targeting
    [`StatisticalRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/stat/StatisticalRule.html#).

##### Internal APIs

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0. You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

* pmd-core
  * [`net.sourceforge.pmd.cache`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/cache/package-summary.html#)

    subpackages, except [`TypeHelper`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.18.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/typeresolution/TypeHelper.html#) and

### New and noteworthy

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.17.0).
It contains a new feature to edit test cases directly within the designer. Any feedback is highly appreciated.

#### Lua support

Thanks to the contribution from [Maikel Steneker](https://github.com/maikelsteneker), and built on top of the ongoing efforts to fully support Antlr-based languages,
PMD now has CPD support for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

Being based on a proper Antlr grammar, CPD can:
*   ignore comments
*   honor [comment-based suppressions](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression)

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`CloseResource`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.17.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#closeresource) (`java-errorprone`) ignores now by default
    `java.io.ByteArrayInputStream` and `java.io.CharArrayWriter`. Such streams/writers do not need to be closed.

*   The Java rule [`MissingStaticMethodInNonInstantiatableClass`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.17.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#missingstaticmethodinnoninstantiatableclass) (`java-errorprone`) has now
    the new property `annotations`.
    When one of the private constructors is annotated with one of the annotations, then the class is not considered
    non-instantiatable anymore and no violation will be reported. By default, Spring's `@Autowired` and
    Java EE's `@Inject` annotations are recognized.

### New and noteworthy

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.16.0).

#### PLSQL Grammar Updates

The grammar has been updated to support inline constraints in CREATE TABLE statements. Additionally, the
CREATE TABLE statement may now be followed by physical properties and table properties. However, these
properties are skipped over during parsing.

The CREATE VIEW statement now supports subquery views.

The EXTRACT function can now be parsed correctly. It is used to extract values from a specified
datetime field. Also date time literals are parsed now correctly.

The CASE expression can now be properly used within SELECT statements.

Table aliases are now supported when specifying columns in INSERT INTO clauses.

#### New Rules

*   The Java rule [`DoubleBraceInitialization`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#doublebraceinitialization) (`java-bestpractices`)
    detects non static initializers in anonymous classes also known as "double brace initialization".
    This can be problematic, since a new class file is generated and object holds a strong reference
    to the surrounding class.
    
    Note: This rule is also part of the Java quickstart ruleset (`rulesets/java/quickstart.xml`).

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`UnusedPrivateField`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unusedprivatefield) (`java-bestpractices`) now ignores by
    default fields, that are annotated with the Lombok experimental annotation `@Delegate`. This can be
    customized with the property `ignoredAnnotations`.

*   The Java rule [`SingularField`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#singularfield) (`java-design`) now ignores by
    default fields, that are annotated with the Lombok experimental annotation `@Delegate`. This can be
    customized with the property `ignoredAnnotations`.

*   The Java rules [`UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticformatter) and
    [`UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticdateformatter) (`java-multithreading`)
    now prefer synchronized blocks by default. They will raise a violation, if the synchronization is implemented
    on the method level. To allow the old behavior, the new property `allowMethodLevelSynchronization` can
    be enabled.

*   The Java rule [`UseUtilityClass`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#useutilityclass) (`java-design`) has a new property `ignoredAnnotations`.
    By default, classes that are annotated with Lombok's `@UtilityClass` are ignored now.

*   The Java rule [`NonStaticInitializer`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#nonstaticinitializer) (`java-errorprone`) does not report
    non static initializers in anonymous classes anymore. For this use case, there is a new rule now:
    [`DoubleBraceInitialization`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#doublebraceinitialization) (`java-bestpractices`).

*   The Java rule [`CommentDefaultAccessModifier`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#commentdefaultaccessmodifier) (`java-codestyle`) was enhanced
    in the last version 6.15.0 to check also top-level types by default. This created many new violations.
    Missing the access modifier for top-level types is not so critical, since it only decreases the visibility
    of the type.
    
    The default behaviour has been restored. If you want to enable the check for top-level types, you can
    use the new property `checkTopLevelTypes`.

*   The Java rule [`CloseResource`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#closeresource) (`java-errorprone`) now by default searches
    for any unclosed `java.lang.AutoCloseable` resource. This includes now the standard `java.io.*Stream` classes.
    Previously only SQL-related resources were considered by this rule. The types can still be configured
    via the `types` property. Some resources do not need to be closed (e.g. `ByteArrayOutputStream`). These
    exceptions can be configured via the new property `allowedResourceTypes`.
    In order to restore the old behaviour, just remove the type `java.lang.AutoCloseable` from the `types`
    property and keep the remaining SQL-related classes.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule [`AvoidFinalLocalVariable`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#avoidfinallocalvariable) (`java-codestyle`) has been deprecated
    and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is controversial and also contradicts other existing
    rules such as [`LocalVariableCouldBeFinal`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#localvariablecouldbefinal). If the goal is to avoid defining
    constants in a scope smaller than the class, then the rule [`AvoidDuplicateLiterals`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.16.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#avoidduplicateliterals)
    should be used instead.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

> Reminder: Please don't use members marked with the annotation [`InternalApi`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.16.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/annotation/InternalApi.html#), as they will likely be removed, hidden, or otherwise intentionally broken with 7.0.0.


##### In ASTs

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the Java AST** (with other languages to come):

* Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and marked [`InternalApi`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.16.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/annotation/InternalApi.html#). Nodes should only be obtained from the parser, which for rules, means that never need to instantiate node themselves. Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
* **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. Version 7.0.0 will bring a new set of abstractions that will be public API, but the base classes are and will stay internal. You should not couple your code to them.
  * In the meantime you should use interfaces like [`JavaNode`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.16.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JavaNode.html#) or  [`Node`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.16.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/Node.html#), or the other published interfaces in this package, to refer to nodes generically.
  * Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
* Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**. We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.

Please look at [`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.16.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/package-summary.html#) to find out the full list
of deprecations.

#### Enhanced Matlab support

Thanks to the contributions from [Maikel Steneker](https://github.com/maikelsteneker) CPD for Matlab can
now parse Matlab programs which use the question mark operator to specify access to
class members:

```
classdef Class1
properties (SetAccess = ?Class2)
```

CPD also understands now double quoted strings, which are supported since version R2017a of Matlab:

```
str = "This is a string"
```

#### Enhanced C++ support

CPD now supports digit separators in C++ (language module "cpp"). This is a C++14 feature.

Example: `auto integer_literal = 1'000'000;`

The single quotes can be used to add some structure to large numbers.

CPD also parses raw string literals now correctly (see [#1784](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1784)).

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`FieldNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#fieldnamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) checks the naming
    conventions for field declarations. By default this rule uses the standard Apex naming convention (Camel case),
    but it can be configured through properties.

*   The new Apex rule [`FormalParameterNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#formalparameternamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) checks the
    naming conventions for formal parameters of methods. By default this rule uses the standard Apex naming
    convention (Camel case), but it can be configured through properties.

*   The new Apex rule [`LocalVariableNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#localvariablenamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) checks the
    naming conventions for local variable declarations. By default this rule uses the standard Apex naming
    convention (Camel case), but it can be configured through properties.

*   The new Apex rule [`PropertyNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#propertynamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) checks the naming
    conventions for property declarations. By default this rule uses the standard Apex naming convention (Camel case),
    but it can be configured through properties.

*   The new Java rule [`UseShortArrayInitializer`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#useshortarrayinitializer) (`java-codestyle`) searches for
    array initialization expressions, which can be written shorter.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Apex rule [`ClassNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#classnamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) can now be configured
    using various properties for the specific kind of type declarations (e.g. class, interface, enum).
    As before, this rule uses by default the standard Apex naming convention (Pascal case).

*   The Apex rule [`MethodNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#methodnamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) can now be configured
    using various properties to differenciate e.g. static methods and test methods.
    As before, this rule uses by default the standard Apex naming convention (Camel case).

*   The Java rule [`FieldNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#fieldnamingconventions) (`java-codestyle`) now by default ignores
    the field `serialPersistentFields`. Since this is a field which needs to have this special name, no
    field naming conventions can be applied here. It is excluded the same way like `serialVersionUID` via the
    property `exclusions`.

*   The Java rule [`CommentRequired`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_documentation.html#commentrequired) (`java-documentation`) has a new property
    `serialPersistentFieldsCommentRequired` with the default value "Ignored". This means that from now
    on comments for the field `serialPersistentFields` are not required anymore. You can change the property
    to restore the old behavior.

*   The Java rule [`ProperLogger`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#properlogger) (`java-errorprone`) has two new properties
    to configure the logger class (e.g. "org.slf4j.Logger") and the logger name of the special case,
    when the logger is not static. The name of the static logger variable was already configurable.
    The new property "loggerClass" allows to use this rule for different logging frameworks.
    This rule covers all the cases of the now deprecated rule [`LoggerIsNotStaticFinal`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#loggerisnotstaticfinal).

*   The Java rule [`CommentDefaultAccessModifier`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#commentdefaultaccessmodifier) (`java-codestyle`) now reports also
    missing comments for top-level classes and annotations, that are package-private.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Apex rule [`VariableNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#variablenamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) has been deprecated and
    will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is replaced by the more general rules
    [`FieldNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#fieldnamingconventions),
    [`FormalParameterNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#formalparameternamingconventions),
    [`LocalVariableNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#localvariablenamingconventions), and
    [`PropertyNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#propertynamingconventions).

*   The Java rule [`LoggerIsNotStaticFinal`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#loggerisnotstaticfinal) (`java-errorprone`) has been deprecated
    and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is replaced by [`ProperLogger`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.15.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#properlogger).

### New and noteworthy

#### Dart support

Thanks to the contribution from [Maikel Steneker](https://github.com/maikelsteneker), and built on top of the ongoing efforts to fully support Antlr-based languages,
PMD now has CPD support for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).

Being based on a proper Antlr grammar, CPD can:
*   ignore comments
*   ignore imports / libraries
*   honor [comment-based suppressions](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression)

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/blob/6.14.0/CHANGELOG.md).

### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`AssignmentToNonFinalStatic`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.14.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#assignmenttononfinalstatic) (`java-errorprone`) will now report on each
    assignment made within a constructor rather than on the field declaration. This makes it easier for developers to
    find the offending statements.

*   The Java rule [`NoPackage`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.14.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#nopackage) (`java-codestyle`) will now report additionally enums
    and annotations that do not have a package declaration.

### New and noteworthy

#### Call For Logo

We are still searching for a new logo for PMD for the next major release.

Learn more about how to participate on [github issue 1663](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1663).

#### Java 12 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 12. PMD can parse the new [Switch Expressions](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325)
and resolve the type of such an expression.

Note: The Switch Expressions are a preview language feature of OpenJDK 12 and are not enabled by default. In order to
analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable it via the new environment
variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd ...

#### Quickstart Ruleset for Apex

PMD provides now a quickstart ruleset for Salesforce.com Apex, which you can use as a base ruleset to
get your custom ruleset started. You can reference it with `rulesets/apex/quickstart.xml`.
You are strongly encouraged to [create your own ruleset](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.12.0/pmd_userdocs_making_rulesets.html)
though.

The quickstart ruleset has the intention, to be useful out-of-the-box for many projects. Therefore it
references only rules, that are most likely to apply everywhere.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

#### PMD Designer

The rule designer's codebase has been moved out of the main repository and
will be developed at [pmd/pmd-designer](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer)
from now on. The maven coordinates will stay the same for the time being.
The designer will still be shipped with PMD's binaries.

#### Improved Apex Support

*   Many AST nodes now expose more information which makes it easier to write XPath-based rules for Apex. Here are
    some examples:
    *   `Annotation[@Resolved = false()]` finds unsupported annotations.
    *   `AnnotationParameter[@Name='RestResource'][@Value='/myurl']` gives access to
        annotation parameters.
    *   `CatchBlockStatement[@ExceptionType='Exception'][@VariableName='e']` finds catch
        block for specific exception types.
    *   `Field[@Type='String']` find all String fields, `Field[string-length(@Name) < 5]`
        finds all fields with short names and `Field[@Value='a']` find alls fields, that are
        initialized with a specific value.
    *   `LiteralExpression[@String = true()]` finds all String literals. There are attributes
        for each type: `@Boolean`, `@Integer`, `@Double`, `@Long`, `@Decimal`, `@Null`.
    *   `Method[@Constructor = true()]` selects all constructors. `Method[@ReturnType = 'String']`
        selects all methods that return a String.
    *   The `ModifierNode` node has a couple of attributes to check for the existence of specific
        modifiers: `@Test`, `@TestOrTestSetup`, `@WithSharing`, `@WithoutSharing`, `@InheritedSharing`,
        `@WebService`, `@Global`, `@Override`.
    *   Many nodes now expose their type. E.g. with `Parameter[@Type='Integer']` you can find all
        method parameters of type Integer. The same attribute `Type` exists as well for:
        `NewObjectExpression`, `Property`, `VariableDeclaration`.
    *   `VariableExpression[@Image='i']` finds all variable usages of the variable "i".

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`AvoidUncheckedExceptionsInSignatures`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_java_design.html#avoiduncheckedexceptionsinsignatures) (`java-design`) finds methods or constructors
    that declare unchecked exceptions in their `throws` clause. This forces the caller to handle the exception,
    even though it is a runtime exception.

*   The new Java rule [`DetachedTestCase`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#detachedtestcase) (`java-errorprone`) searches for public
    methods in test classes, which are not annotated with `@Test`. These methods might be test cases where
    the annotation has been forgotten. Because of that those test cases are never executed.

*   The new Java rule [`WhileLoopWithLiteralBoolean`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#whileloopwithliteralboolean) (`java-bestpractices`) finds
    Do-While-Loops and While-Loops that can be simplified since they use simply `true` or `false` as their
    loop condition.

*   The new Apex rule [`ApexAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#apexassertionsshouldincludemessage) (`apex-bestpractices`)
    searches for assertions in unit tests and checks, whether they use a message argument.

*   The new Apex rule [`ApexUnitTestMethodShouldHaveIsTestAnnotation`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#apexunittestmethodshouldhaveistestannotation) (`apex-bestpractices`)
    searches for methods in test classes, which are missing the `@IsTest` annotation.

*   The new PLSQL rule [`AvoidTabCharacter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_plsql_codestyle.html#avoidtabcharacter) (`plsql-codestyle`) checks, that there are
    no tab characters ("\t") in the source file.

*   The new PLSQL rule [`LineLength`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.13.0/pmd_rules_plsql_codestyle.html#linelength) (`plsql-codestyle`) helps to enforce a maximum
    line length.

### API Changes

#### Command Line Interface

The start scripts `run.sh`, `pmd.bat` and `cpd.bat` support the new environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS`.
This can be used to set arbitrary JVM options for running PMD, such as memory settings (e.g. `PMD_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m`)
or enable preview language features (e.g. `PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview`).

The previously available variables such as `OPTS` or `HEAPSIZE` are deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0.

#### Deprecated API

*   [`CodeClimateRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.13.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/renderers/CodeClimateRule.html#) is deprecated in 7.0.0 because it was unused for 2 years and
    created an unwanted dependency.
    Properties "cc_categories", "cc_remediation_points_multiplier", "cc_block_highlighting" will also be removed.
    See [#1702](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/1702) for more.

*   The Apex ruleset `rulesets/apex/ruleset.xml` has been deprecated and will be removed in 7.0.0. Please use the new
    quickstart ruleset `rulesets/apex/quickstart.xml` instead.

### New and noteworthy

#### Call For Logo

PMD’s logo was great for a long time. But now we want to take the opportunity with the next major release to change
our logo in order to use a more "politically correct" one.

Learn more about how to participate on [github issue 1663](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1663).

#### CPD Suppression for Antlr-based languages

[ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/) students [Matías Fraga](https://github.com/matifraga),
[Tomi De Lucca](https://github.com/tomidelucca) and [Lucas Soncini](https://github.com/lsoncini)
keep working on bringing full Antlr support to PMD. For this release, they have implemented
token filtering in an equivalent way as we did for JavaCC languages, adding support for CPD
suppressions through `CPD-OFF` and `CPD-ON` comments for all Antlr-based languages.

This means, you can now ignore arbitrary blocks of code on:
* Go
* Kotlin
* Swift

Simply start the suppression with any comment (single or multiline) containing `CPD-OFF`,
and resume again with a comment containing `CPD-ON`.

More information is available in [the user documentation](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression).

#### PL/SQL Grammar improvements

*   In this release, many more parser bugs in our PL/SQL support have been fixed. This adds more complete
    support for UPDATE statements and subqueries and hierarchical queries in SELECT statements.
*   Support for analytic functions such as LISTAGG has been added.
*   Conditions in WHERE clauses support now REGEX_LIKE and multiset conditions.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`UseTryWithResources`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.12.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#usetrywithresources) (`java-bestpractices`) searches
    for try-blocks, that could be changed to a try-with-resources statement. This statement ensures that
    each resource is closed at the end of the statement and is available since Java 7.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Apex rule [`MethodNamingConventions`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.12.0/pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#methodnamingconventions) (`apex-codestyle`) has a new
    property `skipTestMethodUnderscores`, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring
    all test methods, either using the `testMethod` modifier or simply annotating them `@isTest`.

## 27-January-2019 - 6.11.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 6.11.0.

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Updated Apex Support

*   The Apex language support has been bumped to version 45 (Spring '19). All new language features are now properly
    parsed and processed.
*   Many nodes now expose more informations, such as the operator for BooleanExpressions. This makes these operators
    consumable by XPath rules, e.g. `//BooleanExpression[@Operator='&&']`.

#### PL/SQL Grammar improvements

*   In this release, many parser bugs in our PL/SQL support have been fixed. This adds e.g. support for
    table collection expressions (`SELECT * FROM TABLE(expr)`).
*   Support for parsing insert statements has been added.
*   More improvements are planned for the next release of PMD.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticformatter) (`java-multithreading`) detects
    unsynchronized usages of static `java.text.Format` instances. This rule is a more generic replacement of the
    rule [`UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticdateformatter) which focused just on `DateFormat`.

*   The new Java rule [`ForLoopVariableCount`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#forloopvariablecount) (`java-bestpractices`) checks for
    the number of control variables in a for-loop. Having a lot of control variables makes it harder to understand
    what the loop does. The maximum allowed number of variables is by default 1 and can be configured by a
    property.

*   The new Java rule [`AvoidReassigningLoopVariables`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#avoidreassigningloopvariables) (`java-bestpractices`) searches
    for loop variables that are reassigned. Changing the loop variables additionally to the loop itself can lead to
    hard-to-find bugs.

*   The new Java rule [`UseDiamondOperator`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#usediamondoperator) (`java-codestyle`) looks for constructor
    calls with explicit type parameters. Since Java 1.7, these type parameters are not necessary anymore, as they
    can be inferred now.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`LocalVariableCouldBeFinal`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#localvariablecouldbefinal) (`java-codestyle`) has a new
    property `ignoreForEachDecl`, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring
    non-final loop variables in a for-each statement.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule [`UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticdateformatter) has been deprecated and
    will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is replaced by the more general
    [`UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticformatter).

### API Changes

* [`StatisticalRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/stat/StatisticalRule.html#) and the related helper classes and base rule classes
are deprecated for removal in 7.0.0. This includes all of [`net.sourceforge.pmd.stat`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/stat/package-summary.html#) and [`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.stat`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/stat/package-summary.html#),
and also [`AbstractStatisticalJavaRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/AbstractStatisticalJavaRule.html#), [`AbstractStatisticalApexRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-apex/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/rule/AbstractStatisticalApexRule.html#) and the like.
The methods [`Report#addMetric`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#addMetric(net.sourceforge.pmd.stat.Metric)) and [`metricAdded`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/ThreadSafeReportListener.html#metricAdded(net.sourceforge.pmd.stat.Metric))
will also be removed.
* [`setProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertySource.html#setProperty(net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.MultiValuePropertyDescriptor,Object[])) is deprecated,
because [`MultiValuePropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/MultiValuePropertyDescriptor.html#) is deprecated as well

### New and noteworthy

#### Kotlin support for CPD

Thanks to [Maikel Steneker](https://github.com/maikelsteneker), CPD now supports [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
This means, you can use CPD to find duplicated code in your Kotlin projects.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`UseUnderscoresInNumericLiterals`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.10.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#useunderscoresinnumericliterals) (`java-codestyle`)
    verifies that numeric literals over a given length (4 chars by default, but configurable) are using
    underscores every 3 digits for readability. The rule only applies to Java 7+ codebases.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.10.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junittestsshouldincludeassert) (`java-bestpractices`)
    now also detects [Soft Assertions](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core).

*   The property `exceptionfile` of the rule [`AvoidDuplicateLiterals`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.10.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#avoidduplicateliterals) (`java-errorprone`)
    has been deprecated and will be removed with 7.0.0. Please use `exceptionList` instead.

### API Changes

#### Properties framework





The properties framework is about to get a lifting, and for that reason, we need to deprecate a lot of APIs
to remove them in 7.0.0. The proposed changes to the API are described [on the wiki](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Property-framework-7-0-0)

##### Changes to how you define properties


* Construction of property descriptors has been possible through builders since 6.0.0. The 7.0.0 API will only allow
construction through builders. The builder hierarchy, currently found in the package [`net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.builders`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/builders/package-summary.html#),
is being replaced by the simpler [`PropertyBuilder`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyBuilder.html#). Their APIs enjoy a high degree of source compatibility.

* Concrete property classes like [`IntegerProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/IntegerProperty.html#) and [`StringMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/StringMultiProperty.html#) will gradually
all be deprecated until 7.0.0. Their usages should be replaced by direct usage of the [`PropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#)
interface, e.g. `PropertyDescriptor<Integer>` or `PropertyDescriptor<List<String>>`.

* Instead of spreading properties across countless classes, the utility class [`PropertyFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#) will become
from 7.0.0 on the only provider for property descriptor builders. Each current property type will be replaced
by a corresponding method on `PropertyFactory`:
  * [`IntegerProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/IntegerProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#intProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#intProperty(java.lang.String))
    * [`IntegerMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/IntegerMultiProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#intListProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#intListProperty(java.lang.String))

  * [`FloatProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/FloatProperty.html#) and [`DoubleProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/DoubleProperty.html#) are both replaced by [`PropertyFactory#doubleProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#doubleProperty(java.lang.String)).
    Having a separate property for floats wasn't that useful.
    * Similarly, [`FloatMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/FloatMultiProperty.html#) and [`DoubleMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/DoubleMultiProperty.html#) are replaced by [`PropertyFactory#doubleListProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#doubleListProperty(java.lang.String)).

  * [`StringProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/StringProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#stringProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#stringProperty(java.lang.String))
    * [`StringMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/StringMultiProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#stringListProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#stringListProperty(java.lang.String))

  * [`RegexProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/RegexProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#regexProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#regexProperty(java.lang.String))

  * [`EnumeratedProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/EnumeratedProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#enumProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#enumProperty(java.lang.String,java.util.Map))
    * [`EnumeratedProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/EnumeratedProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#enumListProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#enumListProperty(java.lang.String,java.util.Map))

  * [`BooleanProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/BooleanProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#booleanProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#booleanProperty(java.lang.String))
    * Its multi-valued counterpart, [`BooleanMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/BooleanMultiProperty.html#), is not replaced, because it doesn't have a use case.

  * [`CharacterProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/CharacterProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#charProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#charProperty(java.lang.String))
    * [`CharacterMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/CharacterMultiProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#charListProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#charListProperty(java.lang.String))

  * [`LongProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/LongProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#longIntProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#longIntProperty(java.lang.String))
    * [`LongMultiProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/LongMultiProperty.html#) is replaced by [`PropertyFactory#longIntListProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyFactory.html#longIntListProperty(java.lang.String))

  * [`MethodProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/MethodProperty.html#), [`FileProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/FileProperty.html#), [`TypeProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/TypeProperty.html#) and their multi-valued counterparts
    are discontinued for lack of a use-case, and have no planned replacement in 7.0.0 for now.
    <!-- TODO complete that as we proceed. -->


Here's an example:
```java
// Before 7.0.0, these are equivalent:
IntegerProperty myProperty = new IntegerProperty("score", "Top score value", 1, 100, 40, 3.0f);
IntegerProperty myProperty = IntegerProperty.named("score").desc("Top score value").range(1, 100).defaultValue(40).uiOrder(3.0f);

// They both map to the following in 7.0.0
PropertyDescriptor<Integer> myProperty = PropertyFactory.intProperty("score").desc("Top score value").require(inRange(1, 100)).defaultValue(40);
```

You're highly encouraged to migrate to using this new API as soon as possible, to ease your migration to 7.0.0.



##### Architectural simplifications

* [`EnumeratedPropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/EnumeratedPropertyDescriptor.html#), [`NumericPropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/NumericPropertyDescriptor.html#), [`PackagedPropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PackagedPropertyDescriptor.html#),
and the related builders (in [`net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.builders`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/builders/package-summary.html#)) will be removed.
These specialized interfaces allowed additional constraints to be enforced on the
value of a property, but made the property class hierarchy very large and impractical
to maintain. Their functionality will be mapped uniformly to [`PropertyConstraint`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/constraints/PropertyConstraint.html#)s,
which will allow virtually any constraint to be defined, and improve documentation and error reporting. The
related methods [`PropertyTypeId#isPropertyNumeric`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyTypeId.html#isPropertyNumeric()) and
[`PropertyTypeId#isPropertyPackaged`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyTypeId.html#isPropertyPackaged()) are also deprecated.

* [`MultiValuePropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/MultiValuePropertyDescriptor.html#) and [`SingleValuePropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/SingleValuePropertyDescriptor.html#)
are deprecated. 7.0.0 will introduce a new XML syntax which will remove the need for such a divide
between single- and multi-valued properties. The method [`PropertyDescriptor#isMultiValue`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#isMultiValue()) will be removed
accordingly.

##### Changes to the PropertyDescriptor interface

* [`preferredRowCount`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#preferredRowCount()) is deprecated with no intended replacement. It was never implemented, and does not belong
  in this interface. The methods [`uiOrder`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#uiOrder()) and `compareTo(PropertyDescriptor)` are deprecated for the
  same reason. These methods mix presentation logic with business logic and are not necessary for PropertyDescriptors to work.
  `PropertyDescriptor` will not extend `Comparable<PropertyDescriptor>` anymore come 7.0.0.
* The method [`propertyErrorFor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#propertyErrorFor(net.sourceforge.pmd.Rule)) is deprecated and will be removed with no intended
  replacement. It's really just a shortcut for `prop.errorFor(rule.getProperty(prop))`.
* `T `[`valueFrom(String)`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#valueFrom(java.lang.String)) and `String `[`asDelimitedString`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#asDelimitedString(java.lang.Object))`(T)` are deprecated and will be removed. These were
  used to serialize and deserialize properties to/from a string, but 7.0.0 will introduce a more flexible
  XML syntax which will make them obsolete.
* [`isMultiValue`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#isMultiValue()) and [`type`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#type()) are deprecated and won't be replaced. The new XML syntax will remove the need
  for a divide between multi- and single-value properties, and will allow arbitrary types to be represented.
  Since arbitrary types may be represented, `type` will become obsolete as it can't represent generic types,
  which will nevertheless be representable with the XML syntax. It was only used for documentation, but a
  new way to document these properties exhaustively will be added with 7.0.0.
* [`errorFor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#errorFor(java.lang.Object)) is deprecated as its return type will be changed to `Optional<String>` with the shift to Java 8.

#### Deprecated APIs








##### For internalization

*   The implementation of the adapters for the XPath engines Saxon and Jaxen (package [`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.ast.xpath`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/xpath/package-summary.html#))
    are now deprecated. They'll be moved to an internal package come 7.0.0. Only [`Attribute`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/xpath/Attribute.html#) remains public API.

*   The classes [`PropertyDescriptorField`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptorField.html#), [`PropertyDescriptorBuilderConversionWrapper`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/builders/PropertyDescriptorBuilderConversionWrapper.html#), and the methods
    [`PropertyDescriptor#attributeValuesById`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#attributeValuesById), [`PropertyDescriptor#isDefinedExternally`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyDescriptor.html#isDefinedExternally()) and [`PropertyTypeId#getFactory`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertyTypeId.html#getFactory()).
    These were used to read and write properties to and from XML, but were not intended as public API.

*   The class [`ValueParserConstants`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/ValueParserConstants.html#) and the interface [`ValueParser`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/ValueParser.html#).

*   All classes from [`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.metrics.impl.visitors`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/metrics/impl/visitors/package-summary.html#) are now considered internal API. They're deprecated
    and will be moved into an internal package with 7.0.0. To implement your own metrics visitors,
    [`JavaParserVisitorAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JavaParserVisitorAdapter.html#) should be directly subclassed.

*   [`LanguageVersionHandler#getDataFlowHandler()`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/LanguageVersionHandler.html#getDataFlowHandler()), [`LanguageVersionHandler#getDFAGraphRule()`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/LanguageVersionHandler.html#getDFAGraphRule())

*   [`VisitorStarter`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/VisitorStarter.html#)

##### For removal

*   All classes from [`net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.modules`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/modules/package-summary.html#) will be removed.

*   The interface [`Dimensionable`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/Dimensionable.html#) has been deprecated.
    It gets in the way of a grammar change for 7.0.0 and won't be needed anymore (see [#997](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/997)).

*   Several methods from [`ASTLocalVariableDeclaration`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTLocalVariableDeclaration.html#) and [`ASTFieldDeclaration`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTFieldDeclaration.html#) have
    also been deprecated:

    *   [`ASTFieldDeclaration`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTFieldDeclaration.html#) won't be a [`TypeNode`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/TypeNode.html#) come 7.0.0, so
        [`getType`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTFieldDeclaration.html#getType()) and
        [`getTypeDefinition`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTFieldDeclaration.html#getTypeDefinition()) are deprecated.

    *   The method `getVariableName` on those two nodes will be removed, too.

    All these are deprecated because those nodes may declare several variables at once, possibly
    with different types (and obviously with different names). They both implement `Iterator<`[`ASTVariableDeclaratorId`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTVariableDeclaratorId.html#)`>`
    though, so you should iterate on each declared variable. See [#910](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/910).

*   Visitor decorators are now deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7.0.0. They were originally a way to write
    composable visitors, used in the metrics framework, but they didn't prove cost-effective.

    *   In [`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/package-summary.html#): [`JavaParserDecoratedVisitor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JavaParserDecoratedVisitor.html#), [`JavaParserControllessVisitor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JavaParserControllessVisitor.html#),
        [`JavaParserControllessVisitorAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JavaParserControllessVisitorAdapter.html#), and [`JavaParserVisitorDecorator`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/JavaParserVisitorDecorator.html#) are deprecated with no intended replacement.


*   The LanguageModules of several languages, that only support CPD execution, have been deprecated. These languages
    are not fully supported by PMD, so having a language module does not make sense. The functionality of CPD is
    not affected by this change. The following classes have been deprecated and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0:

    *   [`CppHandler`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-cpp/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/cpp/CppHandler.html#)
    *   [`CppLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-cpp/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/cpp/CppLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`CppParser`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-cpp/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/cpp/CppParser.html#)
    *   [`CsLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-cs/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/cs/CsLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`FortranLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-fortran/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/fortran/FortranLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`GroovyLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-groovy/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/groovy/GroovyLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`MatlabHandler`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-matlab/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/matlab/MatlabHandler.html#)
    *   [`MatlabLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-matlab/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/matlab/MatlabLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`MatlabParser`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-matlab/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/matlab/MatlabParser.html#)
    *   [`ObjectiveCHandler`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-objectivec/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/objectivec/ObjectiveCHandler.html#)
    *   [`ObjectiveCLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-objectivec/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/objectivec/ObjectiveCLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`ObjectiveCParser`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-objectivec/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/objectivec/ObjectiveCParser.html#)
    *   [`PhpLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-php/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/php/PhpLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`PythonHandler`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-python/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/python/PythonHandler.html#)
    *   [`PythonLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-python/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/python/PythonLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`PythonParser`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-python/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/python/PythonParser.html#)
    *   [`RubyLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-ruby/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ruby/RubyLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`ScalaLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-scala/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/scala/ScalaLanguageModule.html#)
    *   [`SwiftLanguageModule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-swift/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/swift/SwiftLanguageModule.html#)


* Optional AST processing stages like symbol table, type resolution or data-flow analysis will be reified
in 7.0.0 to factorise common logic and make them extensible. Further explanations about this change can be
found on [#1426](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/1426). Consequently, the following APIs are deprecated for
removal:
  * In [`Rule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Rule.html#): [`isDfa()`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Rule.html#isDfa()), [`isTypeResolution()`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Rule.html#isTypeResolution()), [`isMultifile()`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Rule.html#isMultifile()) and their
    respective setters.
  * In [`RuleSet`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#): [`usesDFA(Language)`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#usesDFA(net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.Language)), [`usesTypeResolution(Language)`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#usesTypeResolution(net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.Language)), [`usesMultifile(Language)`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.10.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/RuleSet.html#usesMultifile(net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.Language))

### New and noteworthy

#### Improved Golang CPD Support

Thanks to the work of [ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/) students [Matías Fraga](https://github.com/matifraga),
[Tomi De Lucca](https://github.com/tomidelucca) and [Lucas Soncini](https://github.com/lsoncini),
Golang is now backed by a proper Antlr Grammar. This means CPD is now better at detecting duplicates,
as comments are recognized as such and ignored.

#### New Rules

*   The new PLSQL rule [`CodeFormat`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.9.0/pmd_rules_plsql_codestyle.html#codeformat) (`plsql-codestyle`) verifies that
    PLSQL code is properly formatted. It checks e.g. for correct indentation in select statements and verifies
    that each parameter is defined on a separate line.

### API Changes

*   PMD has a new CLI option `-ignorelist`. With that, you can provide a file containing a comma-delimit list of files,
    that should be excluded during analysis. The ignorelist is applied after the files have been selected
    via `-dir` or `-filelist`, which means, if the file is in both lists, then it will be ignored.
    Note: there is no corresponding option for the Ant task, since the feature is already available via
    Ant's FileSet include/exclude filters.

### New and noteworthy

#### Drawing a line between private and public API

Until now, all released public members and types were implicitly considered part
of PMD's public API, including inheritance-specific members (protected members, abstract methods).
We have maintained those APIs with the goal to preserve full binary compatibility between minor releases,
only breaking those APIs infrequently, for major releases.

In order to allow PMD to move forward at a faster pace, this implicit contract will
be invalidated with PMD 7.0.0. We now introduce more fine-grained distinctions between
the type of compatibility support we guarantee for our libraries, and ways to make
them explicit to clients of PMD.

###### `.internal` packages and `@InternalApi` annotation

*Internal API* is meant for use *only* by the main PMD codebase. Internal types and methods
may be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time.

Any API in a package that contains an `.internal` segment is considered internal.
The `@InternalApi` annotation will be used for APIs that have to live outside of
these packages, e.g. methods of a public type that shouldn't be used outside of PMD (again,
these can be removed anytime).

###### `@ReservedSubclassing`

Types marked with the `@ReservedSubclassing` annotation are only meant to be subclassed
by classes within PMD. As such, we may add new abstract methods, or remove protected methods,
at any time. All published public members remain supported. The annotation is *not* inherited, which
means a reserved interface doesn't prevent its implementors to be subclassed.

###### `@Experimental`

APIs marked with the `@Experimental` annotation at the class or method level are subject to change.
They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. You should not use or rely
 on them in any production code. They are purely to allow broad testing and feedback.

###### `@Deprecated`

APIs marked with the `@Deprecated` annotation at the class or method level will remain supported
until the next major release but it is recommended to stop using them.

###### The transition

*All currently supported APIs will remain so until 7.0.0*. All APIs that are to be moved to
`.internal` packages or hidden will be tagged `@InternalApi` before that major release, and
the breaking API changes will be performed in 7.0.0.


#### Quickstart Ruleset

PMD 6.8.0 provides a first quickstart ruleset for Java, which you can use as a base ruleset to get your
custom ruleset started. You can reference it with `rulesets/java/quickstart.xml`.
You are strongly encouraged to [create your own ruleset](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.7.0/pmd_userdocs_making_rulesets.html)
though.

The quickstart ruleset has the intention, to be useful out-of-the-box for many projects. Therefore it
references only rules, that are most likely to apply everywhere.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.


#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`ApexDoc`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.8.0/pmd_rules_apex_documentation.html#apexdoc) (`apex-documentation`)
    enforces the inclusion of ApexDoc on classes, interfaces, properties and methods; as well as some
    sanity rules for such docs (no missing parameters, parameters' order, and return value). By default,
    method overrides and test classes are allowed to not include ApexDoc.


#### Modified Rules

*   The rule [`MissingSerialVersionUID`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.8.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#missingserialversionuid) (`java-errorprone`) has been modified
    in order to recognize also missing `serialVersionUID` fields in abstract classes, if they are serializable.
    Each individual class in the inheritance chain needs an own serialVersionUID field. See also [Should an abstract class have a serialVersionUID](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/893259/should-an-abstract-class-have-a-serialversionuid).
    This change might lead to additional violations in existing code bases.


#### PLSQL

The grammar for PLSQL has been revamped in order to fully parse `SELECT INTO`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`
statements. Previously such statements have been simply skipped ahead, now PMD is parsing them, giving access
to the individual parts of a SELECT-statement, such as the Where-Clause. This might produce new parsing errors
where PMD previously could successfully parse PLSQL code. If this happens, please report a new [issue](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/new) to get this problem fixed.

### API Changes

*   A couple of methods and fields in `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.AbstractPropertySource` have been
    deprecated, as they are replaced by already existing functionality or expose internal implementation
    details: `propertyDescriptors`, `propertyValuesByDescriptor`,
    `copyPropertyDescriptors()`, `copyPropertyValues()`, `ignoredProperties()`, `usesDefaultValues()`,
    `useDefaultValueFor()`.

*   Some methods in `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.PropertySource` have been deprecated as well:
    `usesDefaultValues()`, `useDefaultValueFor()`, `ignoredProperties()`.

*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.AbstractDelegateRule` has been deprecated and will
    be removed with PMD 7.0.0. It is internally only in use by RuleReference.

*   The default constructor of `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.RuleReference` has been deprecated
    and will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. RuleReferences should only be created by providing a Rule and
    a RuleSetReference. Furthermore the following methods are deprecated: `setRuleReference()`,
    `hasOverriddenProperty()`, `usesDefaultValues()`, `useDefaultValueFor()`.

## 02-September-2018 - 6.7.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 6.7.0.

### New and noteworthy

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule java/bestpractices/OneDeclarationPerLine %} (`java-bestpractices`) has been revamped to
    consider not only local variable declarations, but field declarations too.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule java/codestyle/LinguisticNaming %} (`java-codestyle`)
    detects cases, when a method name indicates it returns a boolean (such as `isSmall()`) but it doesn't.
    Besides method names, the rule also checks field and variable names. It also checks, that getters return
    something but setters won't. The rule has several properties with which it can be customized.

*   The new PL/SQL rule {% rule plsql/codestyle/ForLoopNaming %} (`plsql-codestyle`)
    enforces a naming convention for "for loops". Both "cursor for loops" and "index for loops" are covered.
    The rule can be customized via patterns. By default, short variable names are reported.

*   The new Java rule {% rule java/codestyle/FieldNamingConventions %} (`java-codestyle`)
    detects field names that don't comply to a given convention. It defaults to standard Java convention of using camelCase,
    but can be configured with ease for e.g. constants or static fields.

*   The new Apex rule {% rule apex/codestyle/OneDeclarationPerLine %} (`apex-codestyle`) enforces declaring a
    single field / variable per line; or per statement if the `strictMode` property is set.
    It's an Apex equivalent of the already existing Java rule of the same name.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rules {% rule java/codestyle/VariableNamingConventions %}, {% rule java/codestyle/MIsLeadingVariableName %},
    {% rule java/codestyle/SuspiciousConstantFieldName %}, and {% rule java/codestyle/AvoidPrefixingMethodParameters %} are 
    now deprecated, and will be removed with version 7.0.0. They are replaced by the more general
    {% rule java/codestyle/FieldNamingConventions %}, {% rule java/codestyle/FormalParameterNamingConventions %}, and
    {% rule java/codestyle/LocalVariableNamingConventions %}.

### API Changes

*   All classes in the package `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.report` have been deprecated and will be removed
    with PMD 7.0.0. This includes the class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.report.ReportTree`. The reason is,
    that this class is very specific to Java and not suitable for other languages. It has only been used for
    `YAHTMLRenderer`, which has been rewritten to work without these classes.
    
*   The nodes RUNSIGNEDSHIFT and RSIGNEDSHIFT are deprecated and will be removed from the AST with PMD 7.0.0.
    These represented the operator of ShiftExpression in two cases out of three, but they're not needed and
    make ShiftExpression inconsistent. The operator of a ShiftExpression is now accessible through
    ShiftExpression#getOperator.

### New and noteworthy

#### Java 11 Support

PMD is now able to parse the local-variable declaration syntax `var xxx`, that has been
extended for lambda parameters with Java 11 via
[JEP 323: Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/323).

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`LocalVariableNamingConventions`](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#localvariablenamingconventions)
    (`java-codestyle`) detects local variable names that don't comply to a given convention. It defaults to standard
    Java convention of using camelCase, but can be configured. Special cases can be configured for final variables
    and caught exceptions' names.

*   The new Java rule [`FormalParameterNamingConventions`](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#formalparameternamingconventions)
    (`java-codestyle`) detects formal parameter names that don't comply to a given convention. It defaults to
    standard Java convention of using camelCase, but can be configured. Special cases can be configured for final
    parameters and lambda parameters (considering whether they are explicitly typed or not).

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rules [`AccessorClassGeneration`](pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#accessorclassgeneration) and
    [`AccessorMethodGeneration`](pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#accessormethodgeneration) (both in category
    `java-bestpractices`) have been modified to be only valid up until Java 10. Java 11 adds support for
    [JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Control](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/181) which avoids the generation of
    accessor classes / methods altogether.

### Fixed Issues

### API Changes

*   The `findDescendantsOfType` methods in `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.ast.AbstractNode` no longer search for
    exact type matches, but will match subclasses, too. That means, it's now possible to look for abstract node
    types such as `AbstractJavaTypeNode` and not only for it's concrete subtypes.

### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule [`AvoidNonExistentAnnotations`](pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#avoidnonexistentannotations) (`apex-errorprone`)
    detects usages non-officially supported annotations. Apex supported non existent annotations for legacy reasons.
    In the future, use of such non-existent annotations could result in broken Apex code that will not compile.
    A full list of supported annotations can be found [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_annotation.htm)

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [UnnecessaryModifier](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessarymodifier) (`java-codestyle`)
    now detects enum constrcutors with explicit `private` modifier. The rule now produces better error messages
    letting you know exactly which modifiers are redundant at each declaration.

### API Changes

*   The utility class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.ast.CommentUtil` has been deprecated and will be removed
    with PMD 7.0.0. Its methods have been intended to parse javadoc tags. A more useful solution will be added
    around the AST node `FormalComment`, which contains as children `JavadocElement` nodes, which in
    turn provide access to the `JavadocTag`.
    
    All comment AST nodes (`FormalComment`, `MultiLineComment`, `SingleLineComment`) have a new method
    `getFilteredComment()` which provide access to the comment text without the leading `/*` markers.

*   The method `AbstractCommentRule.tagsIndicesIn()` has been deprecated and will be removed with
    PMD 7.0.0. It is not very useful, since it doesn't extract the information
    in a useful way. You would still need check, which tags have been found, and with which
    data they might be accompanied.

## 29-May-2018 - 6.4.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 6.4.0.

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Java 10 Support

PMD is now able to understand local-variable type inference as introduced by Java 10.
Simple type resolution features are available, e.g. the type of the variable `s` is inferred
correctly as `String`:

    var s = "Java 10";

#### XPath Type Resolution Functions

For some time now PMD has supported Type Resolution, and exposed this functionality to XPath rules for the Java language
with the `typeof` function. This function however had a number of shortcomings:

*   It would take a first arg with the name to match if types couldn't be resolved. In all cases this was `@Image`
    but was still required.
*   It required 2 separate arguments for the Fully Qualified Class Name and the simple name of the class against
    which to test.
*   If only the Fully Qualified Class Name was provided, no simple name check was performed (not documented,
    but abused on some rules to "fix" some false positives).

In this release we are deprecating `typeof` in favor of a simpler `typeIs` function, which behaves exactly as the
old `typeof` when given all 3 arguments.

`typeIs` receives a single parameter, which is the fully qualified name of the class to test against.

So, calls such as:

```ruby
//ClassOrInterfaceType[typeof(@Image, 'junit.framework.TestCase', 'TestCase')]
```

can now we expressed much more concisely as:

```ruby
//ClassOrInterfaceType[typeIs('junit.framework.TestCase')]
```

With this change, we also allow to check against array types by just appending `[]` to the fully qualified class name.
These can be repeated for arrays of arrays (e.g. `byte[][]` or `java.lang.String[]`).

Additionally, we introduce the companion function `typeIsExactly`, that receives the same parameters as `typeIs`,
but checks for exact type matches, without considering the type hierarchy. That is, the test
`typeIsExactly('junit.framework.TestCase')` will match only if the context node is an instance of `TestCase`, but
not if it's an instance of a subclass of `TestCase`. Be aware then, that using that method with abstract types will
never match.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`HardCodedCryptoKey`](pmd_rules_java_security.html#hardcodedcryptokey) (`java-security`)
    detects hard coded keys used for encryption. It is recommended to store keys outside of the source code.

*   The new Java rule [`IdenticalCatchBranches`](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#identicalcatchbranches) (`java-codestyle`)
    finds catch blocks,
    that catch different exception but perform the same exception handling and thus can be collapsed into a
    multi-catch try statement.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [JUnit4TestShouldUseTestAnnotation](pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junit4testshouldusetestannotation) (`java-bestpractices`)
    has a new parameter "testClassPattern". It is used to distinguish test classes from other classes and
    avoid false positives. By default, any class, that has "Test" in its name, is considered a test class.

*   The Java rule [CommentDefaultAccessModifier](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#commentdefaultaccessmodifier) (`java-codestyle`)
    allows now by default the comment "`/* package */` in addition to "`/* default */`. This behavior can
    still be adjusted by setting the property `regex`.

### API Changes

* The following classes in package `net.sourceforge.pmd.benchmark` have been deprecated: `Benchmark`, `Benchmarker`,
  `BenchmarkReport`, `BenchmarkResult`, `RuleDuration`, `StringBuilderCR` and `TextReport`. Their API is not supported anymore
  and is disconnected from the internals of PMD. Use the newer API based around `TimeTracker` instead, which can be found
  in the same package.
* The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.xpath.TypeOfFunction` has been deprecated. Use the newer `TypeIsFunction` in the same package.
* The `typeof` methdos in `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.xpath.JavaFunctions` have been deprecated.
  Use the newer `typeIs` method in the same class instead..
* The methods `isA`, `isEither` and `isNeither` of `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.typeresolution.TypeHelper`.
  Use the new `isExactlyAny` and `isExactlyNone` methods in the same class instead.

## 29-April-2018 - 6.3.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 6.3.0.

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Tree Traversal Revision

As described in [#904](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/904), when searching for child nodes of the AST methods
such as `hasDescendantOfType`, `getFirstDescendantOfType` and `findDescendantsOfType` were found to behave inconsistently,
not all of them honoring find boundaries; that is, nodes that define a self-contained entity which should be considered separately
(think of lambdas, nested classes, anonymous classes, etc.). We have modified these methods to ensure all of them honor
find boundaries.

This change implies several false positives / unexpected results
(ie: `ASTBlockStatement` falsely returning `true` to `isAllocation()`)
have been fixed; and lots of searches are now restricted to smaller search areas, which improves performance
(depending on the project, we have measured up to 10% improvements during Type Resolution, Symbol Table analysis,
and some rules' application).

#### Naming Rules Enhancements

*   [ClassNamingConventions](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#classnamingconventions) (`java-codestyle`)
    has been enhanced to allow granular configuration of naming
    conventions for different kinds of type declarations (eg enum or abstract
    class). Each kind of declaration can use its own naming convention
    using a regex property. See the rule's documentation for more info about
    configuration and default conventions.

*   [MethodNamingConventions](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#methodnamingconventions) (`java-codestyle`)
    has been enhanced in the same way.

#### CPD Suppression

Back in PMD 5.6.0 we introduced the ability to suppress CPD warnings in Java using comments, by
including `CPD-OFF` (to start ignoring code), or `CPD-ON` (to resume analysis) during CPD execution.
This has proved to be much more flexible and versatile than the old annotation-based approach,
and has since been the preferred way to suppress CPD warnings.

On this occasion, we are extending support for comment-based suppressions to many other languages:

*   C/C++
*   Ecmascript / Javascript
*   Matlab
*   Objective-C
*   PL/SQL
*   Python

So for instance, in Python we could now do:

```python
class BaseHandler(object):
    def __init__(self):
        # some unignored code

        # tell cpd to start ignoring code - CPD-OFF

        # mission critical code, manually loop unroll
        GoDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        GoDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        GoDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        GoDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        GoDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        GoDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);

        # resume CPD analysis - CPD-ON

        # further code will *not* be ignored
```

Other languages are equivalent.

#### Swift 4.1 Support

Thanks to major contributions from [kenji21](https://github.com/kenji21) the Swift grammar has been updated to
support Swift 4.1. This is a major update, since the old grammar was quite dated, and we are sure all iOS
developers will enjoy it.

Unfortunately, this change is not compatible. The grammar elements that have been removed (ie: the keywords `__FILE__`,
`__LINE__`, `__COLUMN__` and `__FUNCTION__`) are no longer supported. We don't usually introduce such
drastic / breaking changes in minor releases, however, given that the whole Swift ecosystem pushes hard towards
always using the latest versions, and that Swift needs all code and libraries to be currently compiling against
the same Swift version, we felt strongly this change was both safe and necessary to be shipped as soon as possible.
We had great feedback from the community during the process but if you have a legitimate use case for older Swift
versions, please let us know [on our Issue Tracker](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues).

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [InsecureCryptoIv](pmd_rules_java_security.html#insecurecryptoiv) (`java-security`)
    detects hard coded initialization vectors used in cryptographic operations. It is recommended to use
    a randomly generated IV.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [UnnecessaryConstructor](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryconstructor) (`java-codestyle`)
    has been rewritten as a Java rule (previously it was a XPath-based rule). It supports a new property
    `ignoredAnnotations` and ignores by default empty constructors,
    that are annotated with `javax.inject.Inject`. Additionally, it detects now also unnecessary private constructors
    in enums.

*   The property `checkNativeMethods` of the Java rule [MethodNamingConventions](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#methodnamingconventions) (`java-codestyle`)
    is now deprecated, as it is now superseded by `nativePattern`. Support for that property will be maintained until
    7.0.0.

*   The Java rule [ControlStatementBraces](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#controlstatementbraces) (`java-codestyle`)
    supports a new boolean property `checkSingleIfStmt`. When unset, the rule won't report `if` statements which lack
    braces, if the statement is not part of an `if ... else if` chain. This property defaults to true.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule [AbstractNaming](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#abstractnaming) (`java-codestyle`) is deprecated

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 6.2.0.

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Ecmascript (JavaScript)

The [Rhino Library](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino) has been upgraded from version 1.7.7 to version 1.7.7.2.

Detailed changes for changed in Rhino can be found:
* [For 1.7.7.2](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md#rhino-1772)
* [For 1.7.7.1](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md#rhino-1771)

Both are bugfixing releases.

#### Disable Incremental Analysis

Some time ago, we added support for [Incremental Analysis](pmd_userdocs_incremental_analysis.html). On PMD 6.0.0, we
started to add warns when not using it, as we strongly believe it's a great improvement to our user's experience as
analysis time is greatly reduced; and in the future we plan to have it enabled by default. However, we realize some
scenarios don't benefit from it (ie: CI jobs), and having the warning logged can be noisy and cause confusion.

To this end, we have added a new flag to allow you to explicitly disable incremental analysis. On CLI, this is
the new `-no-cache` flag. On Ant, there is a `noCache` attribute for the `<pmd>` task.

On both scenarios, disabling the cache takes precedence over setting a cache location.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`MissingOverride`](pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#missingoverride)
    (category `bestpractices`) detects overridden and implemented methods, which are not marked with the
    `@Override` annotation. Annotating overridden methods with `@Override` ensures at compile time that
    the method really overrides one, which helps refactoring and clarifies intent.

*   The new Java rule [`UnnecessaryAnnotationValueElement`](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#unnecessaryannotationvalueelement)
    (category `codestyle`) detects annotations with a single element (`value`) that explicitely names it.
    That is, doing `@SuppressWarnings(value = "unchecked")` would be flagged in favor of
    `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")`.

*   The new Java rule [`ControlStatementBraces`](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#controlstatementbraces)
    (category `codestyle`) enforces the presence of braces on control statements where they are optional.
    Properties allow to customize which statements are required to have braces. This rule replaces the now
    deprecated rules `WhileLoopMustUseBraces`, `ForLoopMustUseBraces`, `IfStmtMustUseBraces`, and
    `IfElseStmtMustUseBraces`. More than covering the use cases of those rules, this rule also supports
    `do ... while` statements and `case` labels of `switch` statements (disabled by default).

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `CommentContentRule` (`java-documentation`) previously had the property `wordsAreRegex`. But this 
    property never had been implemented and is removed now.

*   The Java rule `UnusedPrivateField` (`java-bestpractices`) now has a new `ignoredAnnotations` property
    that allows to configure annotations that imply the field should be ignored. By default `@java.lang.Deprecated`
    and `@javafx.fxml.FXML` are ignored.

*   The Java rule `UnusedPrivateMethod` (`java-bestpractices`) now has a new `ignoredAnnotations` property
    that allows to configure annotations that imply the method should be ignored. By default `@java.lang.Deprecated`
    is ignored.

*   The Java rule `ImmutableField` (`java-design`) now has a new `ignoredAnnotations` property
    that allows to configure annotations that imply the method should be ignored. By default several `lombok`
    annotations are ignored

*   The Java rule `SingularField` (`java-design`) now has a new `ignoredAnnotations` property
    that allows to configure annotations that imply the method should be ignored. By default several `lombok`
    annotations are ignored

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rules `WhileLoopMustUseBraces`, `ForLoopMustUseBraces`, `IfStmtMustUseBraces`, and `IfElseStmtMustUseBraces`
    are deprecated. They will be replaced by the new rule `ControlStatementBraces`, in the category `codestyle`.

### Fixed Issues

    *   [#992](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/992): \[core] Include info about rule doc generation in "Writing Documentation" md page

### API Changes

*    A new CLI switch, `-no-cache`, disables incremental analysis and the related suggestion. This overrides the
    `-cache` option. The corresponding Ant task parameter is `noCache`.

*   The static method `PMDParameters.transformParametersIntoConfiguration(PMDParameters)` is now deprecated,
    for removal in 7.0.0. The new instance method `PMDParameters.toConfiguration()` replaces it.

*   The method `ASTConstructorDeclaration.getParameters()` has been deprecated in favor of the new method
    `getFormalParameters()`. This method is available for both `ASTConstructorDeclaration` and
    `ASTMethodDeclaration`.

### API Changes

#### Changes to the Node interface

The method `getXPathNodeName` is added to the `Node` interface, which removes the
use of the `toString` of a node to get its XPath element name (see [#569](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/569)).
A default implementation is provided in `AbstractNode`, to stay compatible
with existing implementors.

The `toString` method of a Node is not changed for the time being, and still produces
the name of the XPath node. That behaviour may however change in future major releases,
e.g. to produce a more useful message for debugging.

#### Changes to CPD renderers

The interface `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Renderer` has been deprecated. A new interface `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.renderer.CPDRenderer`
has been introduced to replace it. The main difference is that the new interface is meant to render directly to a `java.io.Writer`
rather than to a String. This allows to greatly reduce the memory footprint of CPD, as on large projects, with many duplications,
it was causing `OutOfMemoryError`s (see [#795](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/795)).

`net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.FileReporter` has also been deprecated as part of this change, as it's no longer needed.

## 21-January-2018 - 6.0.1

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 6.0.1.

This is a bug fixing release.

### Table Of Contents

* [Additional information about the new introduced rule categories](#additional-information-about-the-new-introduced-rule-categories)
* [Fixed Issues](#fixed-issues)
* [API Changes](#api-changes)
* [External Contributions](#external-contributions)

### Additional information about the new introduced rule categories

With the release of PMD 6.0.0, all rules have been sorted into one of the following eight categories:

1.  **Best Practices**: These are rules which enforce generally accepted best practices.
2.  **Code Style**: These rules enforce a specific coding style.
3.  **Design**: Rules that help you discover design issues.
4.  **Documentation**: These rules are related to code documentation.
5.  **Error Prone**: Rules to detect constructs that are either broken, extremely confusing or prone to runtime errors.
6.  **Multithreading**: These are rules that flag issues when dealing with multiple threads of execution.
7.  **Performance**: Rules that flag suboptimal code.
8.  **Security**: Rules that flag potential security flaws.

Please note, that not every category in every language may have a rule. There might be categories with no
rules at all, such as `category/java/security.xml`, which has currently no rules.
There are even languages, which only have rules of one category (e.g. `category/xml/errorprone.xml`).

You can find the information about available rules in the generated rule documentation, available
at <https://pmd.github.io/6.0.1/>.

In order to help migrate to the new category scheme, the new name for the old, deprecated rule names will
be logged as a warning. See [PR #865](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/865). Please note, that the deprecated
rule names will keep working throughout PMD 6. You can upgrade to PMD 6 without the immediate need
to migrate your current ruleset. That backwards compatibility will be maintained until PMD 7.0.0 is released.

### New and noteworthy

#### New Rule Designer

Thanks to [Clément Fournier](https://github.com/oowekyala), we now have a new rule designer GUI, which
is based on JavaFX. It replaces the old designer and can be started via

*   `bin/run.sh designer` (on Unix-like platform such as Linux and Mac OS X)
*   `bin\designer.bat` (on Windows)

Note: At least Java8 is required for the designer. The old designer is still available
as `designerold` but will be removed with the next major release.

#### Java 9 support

The Java grammar has been updated to support analyzing Java 9 projects:

*   private methods in interfaces are possible
*   The underscore "\_" is considered an invalid identifier
*   Diamond operator for anonymous classes
*   The module declarations in `module-info.java` can be parsed
*   Concise try-with-resources statements are supported

Java 9 support is enabled by default. You can switch back to an older java version
via the command line, e.g. `-language java -version 1.8`.

#### Revamped Apex CPD

We are now using the Apex Jorje Lexer to tokenize Apex code for CPD. This change means:

*   All comments are now ignored for CPD. This is consistent with how other languages such as Java and Groovy work.
*   Tokenization honors the language specification, which improves accuracy.

CPD will therefore have less false positives and false negatives.

#### Java Type Resolution

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Bendegúz Nagy](https://github.com/WinterGrascph) worked on type resolution
for Java. For this release he has extended support for method calls for both instance and static methods.

Method shadowing and overloading are supported, as are varargs. However, the selection of the target method upon
the presence of generics and type inference is still work in progress. Expect it in forecoming releases.

As for fields, the basic support was in place for release 5.8.0, but has now been expanded to support static fields.

#### Metrics Framework

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Clément Fournier](https://github.com/oowekyala) is worked
on the new metrics framework for object-oriented metrics.

There are already a couple of metrics (e.g. ATFD, WMC, Cyclo, LoC) implemented. More metrics are planned.
Based on those metrics, rules like "GodClass" detection could be implemented more easily.
The following rules benefit from the metrics framework: NcssCount (java), NPathComplexity (java),
CyclomaticComplexity (both java and apex).

The Metrics framework has been abstracted and is available in `pmd-core` for other languages. With this
PMD release, the metrics framework is supported for both Java and Apex.

#### Error Reporting

A number of improvements on error reporting have taken place, meaning changes to some of the report formats.

Also of note, the xml report now provides a XML Schema definition, allowing easier parsing and validation.

##### Processing Errors

Processing errors can now provide not only the message previously included on some reports, but also a full stacktrace.
This will allow better error reports when providing feedback to the PMD team and help in debugging issues.

The report formats providing full stacktrace of errors are:

*   html
*   summaryhtml
*   textcolor
*   vbhtml
*   xml

##### Configuration Errors

For a long time reports have been notified of configuration errors on rules, but they have remained hidden.
On a push to make these more evident to users, and help them get the best results out of PMD, we have started
to include them on the reports.

So far, only reports that include processing errors are showing configuration errors. In other words, the report formats
providing configuration error reporting are:

*   csv
*   html
*   summaryhtml
*   text
*   textcolor
*   vbhtml
*   xml

As we move forward we will be able to detect and report more configuration errors (ie: incomplete `auxclasspath`)
and include them to such reports.

#### Apex Rule Suppression

Apex violations can now be suppressed very similarly to how it's done in Java, by making use of a
`@SuppressWarnings` annotation.

Supported syntax includes:

```
@SupressWarnings('PMD') // to supress all Apex rules
@SupressWarnings('all') // to supress all Apex rules
@SupressWarnings('PMD.ARuleName') // to supress only the rule named ARuleName
@SupressWarnings('PMD.ARuleName, PMD.AnotherRuleName') // to supress only the rule named ARuleName or AnotherRuleName
```

Notice this last scenario is slightly different to the Java syntax. This is due to differences in the Apex grammar for annotations.

#### Rule Categories

All built-in rules have been sorted into one of eight categories:

1.  **Best Practices**: These are rules which enforce generally accepted best practices.
2.  **Code Style**: These rules enforce a specific coding style.
3.  **Design**: Rules that help you discover design issues.
4.  **Documentation**: These rules are related to code documentation.
5.  **Error Prone**: Rules to detect constructs that are either broken, extremely confusing or prone to runtime errors.
6.  **Multithreading**: These are rules that flag issues when dealing with multiple threads of execution.
7.  **Performance**: Rules that flag suboptimal code.
8.  **Security**: Rules that flag potential security flaws.

These categories help you to find rules and figure out the relevance and impact for your project.

All rules have been moved accordingly, e.g. the rule "JumbledIncrementer", which was previously defined in the
ruleset "java-basic" has now been moved to the "Error Prone" category. The new rule reference to be used is
`<rule ref="category/java/errorprone.xml/JumbledIncrementer"/>`.

The old rulesets like "java-basic" are still kept for backwards-compatibility but will be removed eventually.
The rule reference documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule `NcssCount` (category `design`) replaces the three rules "NcssConstructorCount", "NcssMethodCount",
    and "NcssTypeCount". The new rule uses the metrics framework to achieve the same. It has two properties, to
    define the report level for method and class sizes separately. Constructors and methods are considered the same.

*   The new Java rule `DoNotExtendJavaLangThrowable` (category `errorprone`) is a companion for the
    `java-strictexception.xml/DoNotExtendJavaLangError`, detecting direct extensions of `java.lang.Throwable`.

*   The new Java rule `ForLoopCanBeForeach` (category `errorprone`) helps to identify those for-loops that can
    be safely refactored into for-each-loops available since java 1.5.

*   The new Java rule `AvoidFileStream` (category `performance`) helps to identify code relying on `FileInputStream` / `FileOutputStream`
    which, by using a finalizer, produces extra / unnecessary overhead to garbage collection, and should be replaced with
    `Files.newInputStream` / `Files.newOutputStream` available since java 1.7.

*   The new Java rule `DataClass` (category `design`) detects simple data-holders without behaviour. This might indicate
    that the behaviour is scattered elsewhere and the data class exposes the internal data structure,
    which breaks encapsulation.

*   The new Apex rule `AvoidDirectAccessTriggerMap` (category `errorprone`) helps to identify direct array access to triggers,
    which can produce bugs by either accessing non-existing indexes, or leaving them out. You should use for-each-loops
    instead.

*   The new Apex rule `AvoidHardcodingId` (category `errorprone`) detects hardcoded strings that look like identifiers
    and flags them. Record IDs change between environments, meaning hardcoded ids are bound to fail under a different
    setup.

*   The new Apex rule `CyclomaticComplexity` (category `design`) detects overly complex classes and methods. The
    report threshold can be configured separately for classes and methods.

*   A whole bunch of new rules has been added to Apex. They all fit into the category `errorprone`.
    The 5 rules are migrated for Apex from the equivalent Java rules and include:
    * `EmptyCatchBlock` to detect catch blocks completely ignoring exceptions.
    * `EmptyIfStmt` for if blocks with no content, that can be safely removed.
    * `EmptyTryOrFinallyBlock` for empty try / finally blocks that can be safely removed.
    * `EmptyWhileStmt` for empty while loops that can be safely removed.
    * `EmptyStatementBlock` for empty code blocks that can be safely removed.

*   The new Apex rule `AvoidSoslInLoops` (category `performance`) is the companion of the old
    `AvoidSoqlInLoops` rule, flagging SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) queries when within
    loops, to avoid governor issues, and hitting the database too often.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryFinalModifier` (category `codestyle`, former ruleset `java-unnecessarycode`)
    has been merged into the rule `UnnecessaryModifier`. As part of this, the rule  has been revamped to detect more cases.
    It will now flag anonymous class' methods marked as final (can't be overridden, so it's pointless), along with
    final methods overridden / defined within enum instances. It will also flag `final` modifiers on try-with-resources.

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryParentheses` (category `codestyle`, former ruleset `java-controversial`)
    has been merged into `UselessParentheses` (category `codestyle`, former ruleset `java-unnecessary`).
    The rule covers all scenarios previously covered by either rule.

*   The Java rule `UncommentedEmptyConstructor` (category `documentation`, former ruleset `java-design`)
     will now ignore empty constructors annotated with `javax.inject.Inject`.

*   The Java rule `AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod` (category `bestpractices`, former ruleset `java-design`)
    will now ignore classes annotated with `com.google.auto.value.AutoValue`.

*   The Java rule `GodClass` (category `design', former ruleset `java-design`) has been revamped to use
    the new metrics framework.

*   The Java rule `LooseCoupling` (category `bestpractices`, former ruleset `java-coupling`) has been
    replaced by the typeresolution-based implementation.

*   The Java rule `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable` (category `errorprone`, former ruleset `java-clone`)
    has been replaced by the typeresolution-based
    implementation and is now able to detect cases if a class implements or extends a Cloneable class/interface.

*   The Java rule `UnusedImports` (category `bestpractices`, former ruleset `java-imports`) has been
    replaced by the typeresolution-based
    implementation and is now able to detect unused on-demand imports.

*   The Java rule `SignatureDeclareThrowsException` (category `design`, former ruleset 'java-strictexception')
    has been replaced by the
    typeresolution-based implementation. It has a new property `IgnoreJUnitCompletely`, which allows all
    methods in a JUnit testcase to throw exceptions.

*   The Java rule `NPathComplexity` (category `design`, former ruleset `java-codesize`) has been revamped
    to use the new metrics framework.
    Its report threshold can be configured via the property `reportLevel`, which replaces the now
    deprecated property `minimum`.

*   The Java rule `CyclomaticComplexity` (category `design`, former ruleset `java-codesize`) has been
    revamped to use the new metrics framework.
    Its report threshold can be configured via the properties `classReportLevel` and `methodReportLevel` separately.
    The old property `reportLevel`, which configured the level for both total class and method complexity,
    is deprecated.

*   The Java rule `CommentRequired` (category `documentation`, former ruleset `java-comments`)
    has been revamped to include 2 new properties:
    *   `accessorCommentRequirement` to specify documentation requirements for getters and setters (default to `ignored`)
    *   `methodWithOverrideCommentRequirement` to specify documentation requirements for methods annotated with `@Override` (default to `ignored`)

*   The Java rule `EmptyCatchBlock` (category `errorprone`, former ruleset `java-empty`) has been changed to ignore
    exceptions named `ignore` or `expected` by default. You can still override this behaviour by setting the `allowExceptionNameRegex` property.

*   The Java rule `OptimizableToArrayCall` (category `performance`, former ruleset `design`) has been
    modified to fit for the current JVM implementations: It basically detects now the opposite and suggests to
    use `Collection.toArray(new E[0])` with a zero-sized array.
    See [Arrays of Wisdom of the Ancients](https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/).

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rules `NcssConstructorCount`, `NcssMethodCount`, and `NcssTypeCount` (ruleset `java-codesize`) have been
    deprecated. They will be replaced by the new rule `NcssCount` in the category `design`.

*   The Java rule `LooseCoupling` in ruleset `java-typeresolution` is deprecated. Use the rule with the same name
    from category `bestpractices` instead.

*   The Java rule `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable` in ruleset `java-typeresolution` is deprecated. Use the rule with
    the same name from category `errorprone` instead.

*   The Java rule `UnusedImports` in ruleset `java-typeresolution` is deprecated. Use the rule with
    the same name from category `bestpractices` instead.

*   The Java rule `SignatureDeclareThrowsException` in ruleset `java-typeresolution` is deprecated. Use the rule
    with the same name from category `design` instead.

*   The Java rule `EmptyStaticInitializer` in ruleset `java-empty` is deprecated. Use the rule `EmptyInitializer`
    from the category `errorprone`, which covers both static and non-static empty initializers.`

*   The Java rules `GuardDebugLogging` (ruleset `java-logging-jakarta-commons`) and `GuardLogStatementJavaUtil`
    (ruleset `java-logging-java`) have been deprecated. Use the rule `GuardLogStatement` from the
    category `bestpractices`, which covers all cases regardless of the logging framework.

#### Removed Rules

*   The deprecated Java rule `UseSingleton` has been removed from the ruleset `java-design`. The rule has been renamed
    long time ago to `UseUtilityClass` (category `design`).

#### Java Symbol Table

A [bug in symbol table](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/549/commits/0958621ca884a8002012fc7738308c8dfc24b97c) prevented
the symbol table analysis to properly match primitive arrays types. The issue [affected the `java-unsedcode/UnusedPrivateMethod`](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/521)
rule, but other rules may now produce improved results as consequence of this fix.

#### Apex Parser Update

The Apex parser version was bumped, from `1.0-sfdc-187` to `210-SNAPSHOT`. This update let us take full advantage
of the latest improvements from Salesforce, but introduces some breaking changes:

*   `BlockStatements` are now created for all control structures, even if no brace is used. We have therefore added
    a `hasCurlyBrace` method to differentiate between both scenarios.
*   New AST node types are available. In particular `CastExpression`, `ConstructorPreamble`, `IllegalStoreExpression`,
    `MethodBlockStatement`, `Modifier`, `MultiStatement`, `NestedExpression`, `NestedStoreExpression`,
    `NewKeyValueObjectExpression` and `StatementExecuted`
*   Some nodes have been removed. Such is the case of `TestNode`, `DottedExpression` and `NewNameValueObjectExpression`
    (replaced by `NewKeyValueObjectExpression`)

All existing rules have been updated to reflect these changes. If you have custom rules, be sure to update them.

For more info about the included Apex parser, see the new pmd module "pmd-apex-jorje", which packages and provides
the parser as a binary.

#### Incremental Analysis

The incremental analysis feature first introduced in PMD 5.6.0 has been enhanced. A few minor issues have been fixed,
and several improvements have been performed to make it more accurate.

The cache will now detect changes to the JARs referenced in the `auxclasspath` instead of simply looking at their paths
and order. This means that if you are referencing a JAR you are overwriting in some way, the incremental analysis can
now detect it and invalidate it's cache to avoid false reports.

Similarly, any changes to the execution classpath of PMD will invalidate the cache. This means that if you have custom
rules packaged in a jar, any changes to it will invalidate the cache automatically.

We have also improved logging on the analysis code, allowing better insight into how the cache is performing,
under debug / verbose builds you can even see individual hits / misses to the cache (and the reason for any miss!)

Finally, as this feature keeps maturing, we are gently pushing this forward. If not using incremental analysis,
a warning will now be produced suggesting users to adopt it for better performance.

#### Rule and Report Properties

The implementation around the properties support for rule properties and report properties has been revamped
to be fully typesafe. Along with that change, the support classes have been moved into an own
package `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties`. While there is no change necessary in the ruleset XML files,
when using/setting values for rules, there are adjustments necessary when declaring properties in Java-implemented
rules.

Rule properties can be declared both for Java based rules and XPath rules.
This is now very well documented in [Working with properties](pmd_userdocs_extending_defining_properties.html).

With PMD 6.0.0, multivalued properties are now also possible with XPath rules.

### API Changes

*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.NodeType` has been converted to an enum.
    All node types are enum members now instead of int constants. The names for node types are retained.

*   The *Properties API* (rule and report properties) has been revamped to be fully typesafe. This is everything
    around `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.PropertyDescriptor`.

    Note: All classes related to properties have been moved into the package `net.sourceforge.pmd.properties`.

*   The rule classes `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.apex.rule.apexunit.ApexUnitTestClassShouldHaveAsserts`
    and `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.apex.rule.apexunit.ApexUnitTestShouldNotUseSeeAllDataTrue` have been
    renamed to `ApexUnitTestClassShouldHaveAssertsRule` and `ApexUnitTestShouldNotUseSeeAllDataTrueRule`,
    respectively. This is to comply with the naming convention, that each rule class should be suffixed with "Rule".

    This change has no impact on custom rulesets, since the rule names themselves didn't change.

*   The never implemented method `PMD.processFiles(PMDConfiguration, RuleSetFactory, Collection<File>, RuleContext, ProgressMonitor)` along with the interface `ProgressMonitor` has been removed.

*   The method `PMD.setupReport(RuleSets, RuleContext, String)` is gone. It was used to report dysfunctional
    rules. But PMD does this now automatically before processing the files, so there is no need for this
    method anymore.

*   All APIs deprecated in older versions are now removed. This includes:
    *    `Renderer.getPropertyDefinitions`
    *    `AbstractRenderer.defineProperty(String, String)`
    *    `AbstractRenderer.propertyDefinitions`
    *    `ReportListener`
    *    `Report.addListener(ReportListener)`
    *    `SynchronizedReportListener`
    *    `CPDConfiguration.CPDConfiguration(int, Language, String)`
    *    `CPDConfiguration.getRendererFromString(String)`
    *    `StreamUtil`
    *    `StringUtil.appendXmlEscaped(StringBuilder, String)`
    *    `StringUtil.htmlEncode(String)`


*   Several methods in `net.sourceforge.pmd.util.CollectionUtil` have been deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7.0.0. In particular:
    *    `CollectionUtil.addWithoutDuplicates(T[], T)`
    *    `CollectionUtil.addWithoutDuplicates(T[], T[])`
    *    `CollectionUtil.areSemanticEquals(T[], T[])`
    *    `CollectionUtil.areEqual(Object, Object)`
    *    `CollectionUtil.arraysAreEqual(Object, Object)`
    *    `CollectionUtil.valuesAreTransitivelyEqual(Object[], Object[])`


*   Several methods in `net.sourceforge.pmd.util.StringUtil` have been deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7.0.0. In particular:
    *    `StringUtil.startsWithAny(String, String[])`
    *    `StringUtil.isNotEmpty(String)`
    *    `StringUtil.isEmpty(String)`
    *    `StringUtil.isMissing(String)`
    *    `StringUtil.areSemanticEquals(String, String)`
    *    `StringUtil.replaceString(String, String, String)`
    *    `StringUtil.replaceString(String, char, String)`
    *    `StringUtil.substringsOf(String, char)`
    *    `StringUtil.substringsOf(String, String)`
    *    `StringUtil.asStringOn(StringBuffer, Iterator, String)`
    *    `StringUtil.asStringOn(StringBuilder, Object[], String)`
    *    `StringUtil.lpad(String, int)`

*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.typeresolution.typedefinition.JavaTypeDefinition` is now abstract, and has been enhanced
    to provide several new methods.

*   The constructor of `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetFactory`, which took a `ClassLoader` is deprecated.
    Please use the alternative constructor with the `net.sourceforge.pmd.util.ResourceLoader` instead.

*   The following GUI related classes have been deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7.0.0.
    The tool "bgastviewer", that could be started via the script `bgastviewer.bat` or `run.sh bgastviewer` is
    deprecated, too, and will be removed in PMD 7.0.0.

## 24-June-2017 - 5.8.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.8.0.

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Java Type Resolution

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Bendegúz Nagy](https://github.com/WinterGrascph) has been working on completing type resolution for Java.
His progress so far has allowed to properly resolve, in addition to previously supported statements:

 - References to `this` and `super`, even when qualified
 - References to fields, even when chained (ie: `this.myObject.aField`), and properly handling inheritance / shadowing

Lambda parameter types where these are infered rather than explicit are still not supported. Expect future releases to do so.


#### Metrics Framework

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Clément Fournier](https://github.com/oowekyala) has been working on
a new metrics framework for object-oriented metrics.

The basic groundwork has been done already and with this release, including a first rule based on the
metrics framework as a proof-of-concept: The rule *CyclomaticComplexity*, currently in the temporary
ruleset *java-metrics*, uses the Cyclomatic Complexity metric to find overly complex code.
This rule will eventually replace the existing three *CyclomaticComplexity* rules that are currently
defined in the *java-codesize* ruleset (see also [issue #445](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/445)).

Since this work is still in progress, the metrics API (package `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.oom`)
is not finalized yet and is expected to change.


#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryFinalModifier` (ruleset java-unnecessary) now also reports on private methods marked as `final`.
    Being private, such methods can't be overriden, and therefore, the final keyword is redundant.

*   The Java rule `PreserveStackTrace` (ruleset java-design) has been relaxed to support the builder pattern on thrown exception.
    This change may introduce some false positives if using the exception in non-orthodox ways for things other than setting the
    root cause of the exception. Contact us if you find any such scenarios.

*   The ruleset java-junit now properly detects JUnit5, and rules are being adapted to the changes on it's API.
    This support is, however, still incomplete. Let us know of any uses we are still missing on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues)

*   The Java rule `EmptyTryBlock` (ruleset java-empty) now allows empty blocks when using try-with-resources.

*   The Java rule `EmptyCatchBlock` (ruleset java-empty) now exposes a new property called `allowExceptionNameRegex`.
    This allow to setup a regular expression for names of exceptions you wish to ignore for this rule. For instance,
    setting it to `^(ignored|expected)$` would ignore all empty catch blocks where the catched exception is named
    either `ignored` or `expected`. The default ignores no exceptions, being backwards compatible.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The three complexity rules `CyclomaticComplexity`, `StdCyclomaticComplexity`, `ModifiedCyclomaticComplexity` (ruleset java-codesize) have been deprecated. They will be eventually replaced
by a new CyclomaticComplexity rule based on the metrics framework. See also [issue #445](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/445).

## 20-Mai-2017 - 5.7.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.7.0.

This is a minor release.

### New and noteworthy

#### Modified Rules

*   The rule "FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass" of the java-design ruleset has a new property `ignoreInterfaceDeclarations`.
    Setting this property to `true` ignores interface declarations, that precede fields.
    Example usage:


    <rule ref="rulesets/java/design.xml/FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass">
        <properties>
            <property name="ignoreInterfaceDeclarations" value="true"/>
        </properties>
    </rule>

#### Renderers

*   Added the 'empty' renderer which will write nothing.  Does not affect other behaviors, for example the command line PMD exit status
    will still indicate whether violations were found.

## 29-April-2017 - 5.6.1

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.6.1.

This is a bug fixing release.

## 22-April-2017 - 5.6.0

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.6.0.

The most significant changes are on analysis performance, support for Salesforce's Visualforce language
a whole new **Apex Security Rule Set** and the new **Braces Rule Set for Apex**.

We have added initial support for **incremental analysis**. The experimental feature allows
PMD to cache analysis results between executions to speed up the analysis for all
languages. New CLI flags and Ant options are available to configure it. Currently
*the feature is disabled by default*, but this may change as it matures.

Multithread performance has been enhanced by reducing thread-contention on a
bunch of areas. This is still an area of work, as the speedup of running
multithreaded analysis is still relatively small (4 threads produce less
than a 50% speedup). Future releases will keep improving on this area.

Once again, *Symbol Table* has been an area of great performance improvements.
This time we were able to further improve it's performance by roughly 10% on all
supported languages. In *Java* in particular, several more improvements were possible,
improving *Symbol Table* performance by a whooping 80%, that's over 15X faster
than PMD 5.5.1, when we first started working on it.

Java developers will also appreciate the revamp of `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable`,
making it over 500X faster, and `PreserveStackTrace` which is now 7X faster.

### New and noteworthy

#### Incremental Analysis

PMD now supports incremental analysis. Analysis results can be cached and reused between runs.
This allows PMD to skip files without violations that have remained unchanged. In future releases,
we plan to extend this behavior to unchanged files with violations too.

The cache is automatically invalidated if:
 * the used PMD version changes
 * the `auxclasspath` changed and any rules require type resolution
 * the configured rule set has changed

This feature is *incubating* and is disabled by default. It's only enabled if you
specifically configure a cache file.

To configure the cache file from CLI, a new `-cache <path/to/file>` flag has been added.

For Ant, a new `cacheLocation` attribute has been added. For instance:

```xml
    <target name="pmd">
        <taskdef name="pmd" classname="net.sourceforge.pmd.ant.PMDTask"/>
        <pmd cacheLocation="build/pmd/pmd.cache">
            <ruleset>rulesets/java/design.xml</ruleset>
            <ruleset>java-basic</ruleset>
            <formatter type="xml" toFile="c:\pmd_report.xml"/>
            <fileset dir="/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1_01/src/">
                <include name="java/lang/*.java"/>
            </fileset>
        </pmd>
    </target>
```

#### Visualforce Support

Salesforce developers rejoice. To out growing Apex support we have added full Visualforce support.
Both CPD and PD are available. So far only a security ruleset is available (`vf-security`).

##### Visualforce Security Rule Set

###### VfUnescapeEl

The rule looks for Expression Language occurances printing unescaped values from the backend. These
could lead to XSS attacks.

###### VfCsrf

The rule looks for `<apex:page>` tags performing an action on page load, definish such `action`
through Expression Language, as doing so is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

#### Apex Security Rule Set

A new ruleset focused on security has been added, consisting of a wide range of rules
to detect most common security problems.

##### ApexBadCrypto

The rule makes sure you are using randomly generated IVs and keys for `Crypto` calls.
Hard-wiring these values greatly compromises the security of encrypted data.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class without sharing Foo {
    Blob hardCodedIV = Blob.valueOf('Hardcoded IV 123');
    Blob hardCodedKey = Blob.valueOf('0000000000000000');
    Blob data = Blob.valueOf('Data to be encrypted');
    Blob encrypted = Crypto.encrypt('AES128', hardCodedKey, hardCodedIV, data);
}

```

##### ApexCRUDViolation

The rule validates you are checking for access permissions before a SOQL/SOSL/DML operation.
Since Apex runs in system mode not having proper permissions checks results in escalation of
privilege and may produce runtime errors. This check forces you to handle such scenarios.

For example, the following code is considered valid:

```
public class Foo {
    public Contact foo(String status, String ID) {
        Contact c = [SELECT Status__c FROM Contact WHERE Id=:ID];

        // Make sure we can update the database before even trying
        if (!Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fields.Name.isUpdateable()) {
            return null;
        }

        c.Status__c = status;
        update c;
        return c;
    }
}
```

##### ApexCSRF

Check to avoid making DML operations in Apex class constructor/init method. This prevents
modification of the database just by accessing a page.

For instance, the following code would be invalid:

```
public class Foo {
    public init() {
        insert data;
    }

    public Foo() {
        insert data;
    }
}
```

##### ApexDangerousMethods

Checks against calling dangerous methods.

For the time being, it reports:

* Against `FinancialForce`'s `Configuration.disableTriggerCRUDSecurity()`. Disabling CRUD security
opens the door to several attacks and requires manual validation, which is unreliable.
* Calling `System.debug` passing sensitive data as parameter, which could lead to exposure
of private data.

##### ApexInsecureEndpoint

Checks against accessing endpoints under plain **http**. You should always use
**https** for security.

##### ApexOpenRedirect

Checks against redirects to user-controlled locations. This prevents attackers from
redirecting users to phishing sites.

For instance, the following code would be reported:

```
public class without sharing Foo {
    String unsafeLocation = ApexPage.getCurrentPage().getParameters.get('url_param');
    PageReference page() {
       return new PageReference(unsafeLocation);
    }
}
```

##### ApexSharingViolations

Detect classes declared without explicit sharing mode if DML methods are used. This
forces the developer to take access restrictions into account before modifying objects.

##### ApexSOQLInjection

Detects the usage of untrusted / unescaped variables in DML queries.

For instance, it would report on:

```
public class Foo {
    public void test1(String t1) {
        Database.query('SELECT Id FROM Account' + t1);
    }
}
```

##### ApexSuggestUsingNamedCred

Detects hardcoded credentials used in requests to an endpoint.

You should refrain from hardcoding credentials:
  * They are hard to mantain by being mixed in application code
  * Particularly hard to update them when used from different classes
  * Granting a developer access to the codebase means granting knowledge
     of credentials, keeping a two-level access is not possible.
  * Using different credentials for different environments is troublesome
     and error-prone.

Instead, you should use *Named Credentials* and a callout endpoint.

For more information, you can check [this](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_named_credentials.htm)

##### ApexXSSFromEscapeFalse

Reports on calls to `addError` with disabled escaping. The message passed to `addError`
will be displayed directly to the user in the UI, making it prime ground for XSS
attacks if unescaped.

##### ApexXSSFromURLParam

Makes sure that all values obtained from URL parameters are properly escaped / sanitized
to avoid XSS attacks.

#### Apex Braces Rule Set

The Braces Rule Set has been added and serves the same purpose as the Braces Rule Set from Java:
It checks the use and placement of braces around if-statements, for-loops and so on.

##### IfStmtsMustUseBraces

Avoid using if statements without using braces to surround the code block. If the code
formatting or indentation is lost then it becomes difficult to separate the code being
controlled from the rest.

For instance, the following code shows the different. PMD would report on the not recommended approach:

```
if (foo)    // not recommended
    x++;

if (foo) {  // preferred approach
    x++;
}
```

##### WhileLoopsMustUseBraces

Avoid using 'while' statements without using braces to surround the code block. If the code
formatting or indentation is lost then it becomes difficult to separate the code being
controlled from the rest.

For instance, the following code shows the different. PMD would report on the not recommended approach:

```
while (true)    // not recommended
      x++;

while (true) {  // preferred approach
      x++;
}
```

##### IfElseStmtsMustUseBraces

Avoid using if..else statements without using surrounding braces. If the code formatting
or indentation is lost then it becomes difficult to separate the code being controlled
from the rest.

For instance, the following code shows the different. PMD would report on the not recommended approach:

```
// this is not recommended
if (foo)
       x = x+1;
   else
       x = x-1;

// preferred approach
if (foo) {
   x = x+1;
} else {
   x = x-1;
}
```

##### ForLoopsMustUseBraces

Avoid using 'for' statements without using surrounding braces. If the code formatting or
indentation is lost then it becomes difficult to separate the code being controlled
from the rest.

For instance, the following code shows the different. PMD would report on the not recommended approach:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 42; i++) // not recommended
    foo();

for (int i = 0; i < 42; i++) { // preferred approach
    foo();
}
```

#### New Rules

##### AccessorMethodGeneration (java-design)

When accessing a private field / method from another class, the Java compiler will generate an accessor method
with package-private visibility. This adds overhead, and to the dex method count on Android. This situation can
be avoided by changing the visibility of the field / method from private to package-private.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class OuterClass {
    private int counter;
    /* package */ int id;

    public class InnerClass {
        InnerClass() {
            OuterClass.this.counter++; // wrong, accessor method will be generated
        }

        public int getOuterClassId() {
            return OuterClass.this.id; // id is package-private, no accessor method needed
        }
    }
}
```

This new rule is part of the `java-design` ruleset.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn` (ruleset java-design) now has a new property `statementOrderMatters`.
    It is enabled by default to stay backwards compatible. But if this property is set to `false`, this rule
    no longer requires the variable declaration
    and return statement to be on consecutive lines. Any variable that is used solely in a return statement will be
    reported.

*   The Java rule `UseLocaleWithCaseConversions` (ruleset java-design) has been modified, to detect calls
    to `toLowerCase` and to `toUpperCase` also within method call chains. This leads to more detected cases
    and potentially new false positives.
    See also [bugfix #1556](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1556/).

*   The Java rule `AvoidConstantsInterface` (ruleset java-design) has been removed. It is completely replaced by
    the rule `ConstantsInInterface`.

*   The Java rule `UnusedModifier` (ruleset java-unusedcode) has been moved to the ruleset java-unnecessary
    and has been renamed to `UnnecessaryModifier`.
    Additionally, it has been expanded to consider more redundant modifiers:
    *   Annotations marked as `abstract`.
    *   Nested annotations marked as `static`.
    *   Nested annotations within another interface or annotation marked as `public`.
    *   Classes, interfaces or annotations nested within an annotation marked as `public` or `static`.
    *   Nested enums marked as `static`.

*   The Java rule `JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert` (ruleset java-junit) now accepts usage of `@Rule` `ExpectedException`
    to set expectations on exceptions, and are considered as valid assertions.

#### CPD Suppression

It is now possible to allow CPD suppression through comments in **Java**. You tell CPD to ignore
the following code with a comment containin `CPD-OFF` and with `CPD-ON` you tell CPD to resume
analysis. The old approach via `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is still supported, but is considered
**deprecated**, since it is limited to locations where the `SuppressWarnings` annotation is allowed.
See [PR #250](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/250).

For example:

```java
    public Object someMethod(int x) throws Exception {
        // some unignored code

        // tell cpd to start ignoring code - CPD-OFF

        // mission critical code, manually loop unroll
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);

        // resume CPD analysis - CPD-ON

        // further code will *not* be ignored
    }
```

#### CPD filelist command line option

CPD now supports the command line option `--filelist`. With that, you can specify a file, which
contains the names and paths of the files, that should be analyzed. This is similar to PMD's filelist option.
You need to use this, if you have a large project with many files, and you hit the command line length limit.

### API Changes

*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSetFactory` is now immutable and its behavior cannot be changed anymore.
    It provides constructors to create new adjusted instances. This allows to avoid synchronization in RuleSetFactory.
    See [PR #131](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/131).
*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.RuleSet` is now immutable, too, and can only be created via `RuleSetFactory`.
    See [PR #145](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/145).
*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.cli.XPathCLI` has been removed. It's functionality is fully covered by the Designer.
*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.Report` now works with `ThreadSafeReportListener`s. Both `ReportListener` and
    `SynchronizedReportListener` are deprecated in favor of `net.sourceforge.pmd.ThreadSafeReportListener`.
    Therefore, the methods `getSynchronizedListeners()` and `addSynchronizedListeners(...)` have been
    replaced by `getListeners()` and `addListeners(...)`. See [PR #193](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/193).

### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

##### AccessorMethodGeneration (java-design)

When accessing a private field / method from another class, the Java compiler will generate a accessor methods
with package-private visibility. This adds overhead, and to the dex method count on Android. This situation can
be avoided by changing the visibility of the field / method from private to package-private.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class OuterClass {
    private int counter;
    /* package */ int id;

    public class InnerClass {
        InnerClass() {
            OuterClass.this.counter++; // wrong, accessor method will be generated
        }

        public int getOuterClassId() {
            return OuterClass.this.id; // id is package-private, no accessor method needed
        }
    }
}
```

This new rule is part of the `java-design` ruleset.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnusedModifier` (ruleset java-unusedcode) has been expanded to consider more redundant modifiers.
    *   Annotations marked as `abstract`.
    *   Nested annotations marked as `static`.
    *   Nested annotations within another interface or annotation marked as `public`.
    *   Classes, interfaces or annotations nested within an annotation marked as `public` or `static`.
    *   Nested enums marked as `static`.

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn` (ruleset java-design) no longer requires the variable declaration
    and return statement to be on consecutive lines. Any variable that is used solely in a return statement will be
    reported.

## 28-January-2017 - 5.5.3

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.5.3

The most significant changes are on analysis performance and a whole new **Apex Security Rule Set**.

Multithread performance has been enhanced by reducing thread-contention on a
bunch of areas. This is still an area of work, as the speedup of running
multithreaded analysis is still relatively small (4 threads produce less
than a 50% speedup). Future releases will keep improving on this area.

Once again, *Symbol Table* has been an area of great performance improvements.
This time we were able to further improve it's performance by roughly 10% on all
supported languages. In *Java* in particular, several more improvements were possible,
improving *Symbol Table* performance by a whooping 30%, that's over 5X faster
than PMD 5.5.1, when we first started working on it.

Java developers will also appreciate the revamp of `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable`,
making it over 500X faster, and `PreserveStackTrace` which is now 7X faster.

### New and noteworthy

#### Apex Security Rule Set

A new ruleset focused on security has been added, consisting of a wide range of rules
to detect most common security problems.

##### ApexBadCrypto

The rule makes sure you are using randomly generated IVs and keys for `Crypto` calls.
Hard-wiring these values greatly compromises the security of encrypted data.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class without sharing Foo {
    Blob hardCodedIV = Blob.valueOf('Hardcoded IV 123');
    Blob hardCodedKey = Blob.valueOf('0000000000000000');
    Blob data = Blob.valueOf('Data to be encrypted');
    Blob encrypted = Crypto.encrypt('AES128', hardCodedKey, hardCodedIV, data);
}

```

##### ApexCRUDViolation

The rule validates you are checking for access permissions before a SOQL/SOSL/DML operation.
Since Apex runs in system mode not having proper permissions checks results in escalation of
privilege and may produce runtime errors. This check forces you to handle such scenarios.

For example, the following code is considered valid:

```
public class Foo {
    public Contact foo(String status, String ID) {
        Contact c = [SELECT Status__c FROM Contact WHERE Id=:ID];

        // Make sure we can update the database before even trying
        if (!Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fields.Name.isUpdateable()) {
            return null;
        }

        c.Status__c = status;
        update c;
        return c;
    }
}
```

##### ApexCSRF

Check to avoid making DML operations in Apex class constructor/init method. This prevents
modification of the database just by accessing a page.

For instance, the following code would be invalid:

```
public class Foo {
    public init() {
        insert data;
    }

    public Foo() {
        insert data;
    }
}
```

##### ApexDangerousMethods

Checks against calling dangerous methods.

For the time being, it reports:

* Against `FinancialForce`'s `Configuration.disableTriggerCRUDSecurity()`. Disabling CRUD security
opens the door to several attacks and requires manual validation, which is unreliable.
* Calling `System.debug` passing sensitive data as parameter, which could lead to exposure
of private data.

##### ApexInsecureEndpoint

Checks against accessing endpoints under plain **http**. You should always use
**https** for security.

##### ApexOpenRedirect

Checks against redirects to user-controlled locations. This prevents attackers from
redirecting users to phishing sites.

For instance, the following code would be reported:

```
public class without sharing Foo {
    String unsafeLocation = ApexPage.getCurrentPage().getParameters.get('url_param');
    PageReference page() {
       return new PageReference(unsafeLocation);
    }
}
```

##### ApexSharingViolations

Detect classes declared without explicit sharing mode if DML methods are used. This
forces the developer to take access restrictions into account before modifying objects.

##### ApexSOQLInjection

Detects the usage of untrusted / unescaped variables in DML queries.

For instance, it would report on:

```
public class Foo {
    public void test1(String t1) {
        Database.query('SELECT Id FROM Account' + t1);
    }
}
```

##### ApexSuggestUsingNamedCred

Detects hardcoded credentials used in requests to an endpoint.

You should refrain from hardcoding credentials:
  * They are hard to mantain by being mixed in application code
  * Particularly hard to update them when used from different classes
  * Granting a developer access to the codebase means granting knowledge
     of credentials, keeping a two-level access is not possible.
  * Using different credentials for different environments is troublesome
     and error-prone.

Instead, you should use *Named Credentials* and a callout endpoint.

For more information, you can check [this](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_named_credentials.htm)

##### ApexXSSFromEscapeFalse

Reports on calls to `addError` with disabled escaping. The message passed to `addError`
will be displayed directly to the user in the UI, making it prime ground for XSS
attacks if unescaped.

##### ApexXSSFromURLParam

Makes sure that all values obtained from URL parameters are properly escaped / sanitized
to avoid XSS attacks.

#### Modified Rules

The Java rule "UseLocaleWithCaseConversions" (ruleset java-design) has been modified, to detect calls
to `toLowerCase` and to `toUpperCase` also within method call chains. This leads to more detected cases
and potentially new false positives.

## 25-June-2016 - 5.5.0

**System requirements:**

PMD and CPD need at least a java7 runtime environment. For analyzing Salesforce.com Apex source code,
you'll need a java8 runtime environment.

**New Supported Languages:**

*   Salesforce.com Apex is now supported by PMD and CPD. See [PR#86](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/86).
*   CPD now supports Perl. See [PR#82](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/82).
*   CPD now supports Swift. See [PR#33](https://github.com/adangel/pmd/pull/33).

**New and modified Rules:**

*   New rules in Java:
    *   java-logging-java/InvalidSlf4jMessageFormat: Check for invalid message format in slf4j loggers.
        See [PR#73](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/73).
    *   java-design/ConstantsInInterface: Avoid constants in interfaces.
        Interfaces should define types, constants are implementation details
        better placed in classes or enums. See Effective Java, item 19.
        See [PR#93](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/93).

*   Modified rules in Java:
    *   java-comments/CommentRequired: New property `serialVersionUIDCommentRequired` which controls the comment requirements
        for *serialVersionUID* fields. By default, no comment is required for this field.
    *   java-design/UseVargs: public static void main method is ignored now and so are methods, that are annotated
        with Override. See [PR#79](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/79).

*   New rules for Salesforce.com Apex:
    *   apex-complexity: AvoidDeeplyNestedIfStmts, ExcessiveParameterList, ExcessiveClassLength,
        NcssMethodCount, NcssTypeCount, NcssConstructorCount, StdCyclomaticComplexity,
        TooManyFields, ExcessivePublicCount
    *   apex-performance: AvoidDmlStatementsInLoops, AvoidSoqlInLoops
    *   apex-style: VariableNamingConventions, MethodNamingConventions, ClassNamingConventions,
        MethodWithSameNameAsEnclosingClass, AvoidLogicInTrigger, AvoidGlobalModifier

*   Javascript
    *   New Rule: ecmascript-unnecessary/NoElseReturn: The else block in a if-else-construct is
        unnecessary if the `if` block contains a return. Then the content of the else block can be
        put outside. See [#1486](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1486/).

**Improvements and CLI changes:**

*   A JSON-renderer for PMD which is compatible with CodeClimate. See [PR#83](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/83).
*   [#1360](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1360/): \[core] \[java] Provide backwards compatibility for PMD configuration file
*   CPD: If a complete filename is specified, the language dependent filename filter is not applied. This allows
    to scan files, that are not using the standard file extension. If a directory is specified, the filename filter
    is still applied and only those files with the correct file extension of the language are scanned.
*   CPD: If no problems found, an empty report will be output instead of nothing. See also [#1481](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1481/)
*   CPD: New command line parameter `--ignore-usings`: Ignore using directives in C# when comparing text.
*   PMD: New command line parameter: `-norulesetcompatibility` - this disables the ruleset factory
    compatibility filter and fails, if e.g. an old rule name is used in the ruleset.
    See also [#1360](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1360/).
    This option is also available for the ant task: `<noRuleSetCompatibility>true</noRuleSetCompatibility>`.
*   PMD: New command line parameter: `-filelist`- this provides an alternative way to define, which
    files should be process by PMD. With this option, you can provide the path to a single file containing a comma
    delimited list of files to analyze. If this is given, then you don't need to provide `-dir`.
    See [PR#98](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/98).

## 28-January-2017 - 5.4.4

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.4.4

This is a bug fixing release. The most significant changes are on analysis performance.

Multithread performance has been enhanced by reducing thread-contention on a
bunch of areas. This is still an area of work, as the speedup of running
multithreaded analysis is still relatively small (4 threads produce less
than a 50% speedup). Future releases will keep improving on this area.

Once again, *Symbol Table* has been an area of great performance improvements.
This time we were able to further improve it's performance by roughly 10% on all
supported languages. In *Java* in particular, several more improvements were possible,
improving *Symbol Table* performance by a whooping 30%, that's over 5X faster
than PMD 5.4.2, when we first started working on it.

Java developers will also appreciate the revamp of `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable`,
making it over 500X faster, and `PreserveStackTrace` which is now 7X faster.

### New and noteworthy

This is a bug fixing release, no major changes were introduced.

#### Modified Rules

The Java rule "UseLocaleWithCaseConversions" (ruleset java-design) has been modified, to detect calls
to `toLowerCase` and to `toUpperCase` also within method call chains. This leads to more detected cases
and potentially new false positives.
See also [bugfix #1556](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1556/).

**CLI Changes:**

*   CPD: If a complete filename is specified, the language dependent filename filter is not applied. This allows
    to scan files, that are not using the standard file extension. If a directory is specified, the filename filter
    is still applied and only those files with the correct file extension of the language are scanned.
*   CPD: If no problems found, an empty report will be output instead of nothing. See also [#1481](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1481/)
*   New command line parameter for PMD: `-norulesetcompatibility` - this disables the ruleset factory
    compatibility filter and fails, if e.g. an old rule name is used in the ruleset.
    See also [#1360](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1360/).
    This option is also available for the ant task: `<noRuleSetCompatibility>true</noRuleSetCompatibility>`.

**Summary:**

* 9 new rules
* 4 features requests
* 18 pull requests


**Feature Request and Improvements:**

*   [#1344](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1344/): AbstractNaming should check reverse
*   [#1361](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1361/): ShortVariable and ShortMethodName configuration
*   [#1414](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1414/): Command line parameter to disable "failOnViolation" behavior
    PMD and CPD Command Line Interfaces have a new optional parameter: `failOnViolation`. Executing PMD with the option
    `-failOnViolation false` will perform the PMD checks but won't fail the build and still exit with status 0.
    This is useful if you only want to generate the report with violations but don't want to fail your build.
*   [#1420](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1420/): UnusedPrivateField: Ignore fields if using lombok

**New Rules:**

*   Java:

    *   Basic: **SimplifiedTernary** (rulesets/java/basic.xml/SimplifiedTernary)<br/>
        Ternary operator with a boolean literal can be simplified with a boolean
        expression.

    *   Clone: **CloneMethodMustBePublic** (rulesets/java/clone.xml/CloneMethodMustBePublic)<br/>
        The java manual says "By convention,
        classes that implement the `Cloneable` interface should override `Object.clone` (which is protected)
        with a public method."

    *   Clone: **CloneMethodReturnTypeMustMatchClassName** (rulesets/java/clone.xml/CloneMethodReturnTypeMustMatchClassName)<br/>
        If a class implements `Cloneable`
        the return type of the method `clone()` must be the class name.

    *   Comments: **CommentDefaultAccessModifier** (rulesets/java/comments.xml/CommentDefaultAccessModifier)<br/>
        In order to avoid mistakes with
        forgotten access modifiers for methods, this rule ensures, that you explicitly mark the usage of the
        default access modifier by placing a comment.

    *   Design: **SingletonClassReturningNewInstance** (rulesets/java/design.xml/SingletonClassReturningNewInstance)<br/>
        Verifies that the method called `getInstance` returns a cached instance and not always a fresh, new instance.

    *   Design: **SingleMethodRule** (rulesets/java/design.xml/SingleMethodSingletonRule)<br/>
        Verifies that there is only one method called
        `getInstance`. If there are more methods that return the singleton, then it can easily happen, that these
        are not the same instances - and thus no singleton.

    *   Unnecessary: **UselessQualifiedThis** (rulesets/java/unnecessary.xml/UselessQualifiedThis)<br/>
        Flags unnecessary qualified usages
        of this, when `this` alone would be unique. E.g. use just `this` instead of `Foo.this`.

*   Maven POM: (The rules can be found in the *pmd-xml* module)

    *   Basic: **ProjectVersionAsDependencyVersion** (rulesets/pom/basic.xml/ProjectVersionAsDependencyVersion)<br/>
        Checks the usage of `${project.version}` in Maven POM files.

    *   Basic: **InvalidDependencyTypes** (rulesets/pom/basic.xml/InvalidDependencyTypes)<br/>
        Verifies that only the default types (jar, war, ...) for dependencies are used.

Ruleset snippet to activate the new rules:

    <rule ref="rulesets/java/basic.xml/SimplifiedTernary"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/java/clone.xml/CloneMethodReturnTypeMustMatchClassName"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/java/clone.xml/CloneMethodMustBePublic"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/java/comments.xml/CommentDefaultAccessModifier"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/java/design.xml/SingleMethodSingleton"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/java/design.xml/SingletonClassReturningNewInstance"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/java/unnecessary.xml/UselessQualifiedThis"/>

    <rule ref="rulesets/pom/basic.xml/ProjectVersionAsDependencyVersion"/>
    <rule ref="rulesets/pom/basic.xml/InvalidDependencyTypes"/>


**Modified Rules:**

*   Java

    *   Basic: **CheckResultSet** (rulesets/java/basic.xml/CheckResultSet)<br/>
        Do not require to check the result of a navigation method, if it is returned.

    *   JUnit: **UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEquals** (rulesets/java/junit.xml/UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEquals)<br/>
        This rule also flags assertEquals, that use Boolean.TRUE/FALSE constants.

    *   Naming: **AbstractNaming** (rulesets/java/naming.xml/AbstractNaming)<br/>
        By default, this rule flags now classes,
        that are named "Abstract" but are not abstract. This behavior can be disabled by setting
        the new property `strict` to false.

    *   Naming: **ShortMethodName** (rulesets/java/naming.xml/ShortMethodName)<br/>
        Additional property `minimum` to configure the minimum required length of a method name.

    *   Naming: **ShortVariable** (rulesets/java/naming.xml/ShortVariable)<br/>
        Additional property `minimum` to configure the minimum required length of a variable name.

    *   UnusedCode: **UnusedPrivateField** (rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml/UnusedPrivateField)<br/>
        This rule won't trigger anymore if [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) is in use.
        See [#1420](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1420/).

**Renamed Rules:**

*   Java
    *   Design: **<del>UseSingleton</del>** - **UseUtilityClass** (rulesets/java/design.xml/UseUtilityClass)<br/>
        The rule "UseSingleton" *has been renamed* to "UseUtilityClass".
        See also bugs [#1059](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1059) and [#1339](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1339/).

**Removed Rules:**

*   Java
    *   Basic: The following rules of ruleset "Basic" were marked as deprecated and are removed with this release now:<br/>
        <br/>
        EmptyCatchBlock, EmptyIfStatement, EmptyWhileStmt, EmptyTryBlock, EmptyFinallyBlock, EmptySwitchStatements, EmptySynchronizedBlock, EmptyStatementNotInLoop, EmptyInitializer, EmptyStatementBlock, EmptyStaticInitializer
        <br/><br/>
        UnnecessaryConversionTemporary, UnnecessaryReturn, UnnecessaryFinalModifier, UselessOverridingMethod, UselessOperationOnImmutable, UnusedNullCheckInEquals, UselessParentheses
        <br/><br/>
        These rules are still available in the rulesets "Empty" (rulesets/java/empty.xml) and
        "Unnecessary" (rulesets/java/unnecessary.xml) respectively.

    *   Design: The rule "UncommentedEmptyMethod" has been renamed last release to "UncommentedEmptyMethodBody". The
        old rule name reference has been removed with this release now.

    *   Controversial: The rule "BooleanInversion" has been deprecated last release
        and has been removed with this release completely.

    to scan files, that are not using the standard file extension. If a directory is specified, the filename filter
    is still applied and only those files with the correct file extension of the language are scanned.

## 04-October-2015 - 5.3.5

**Modified Rules:**

*   java-design/CloseResource: New Property *closeAsDefaultTarget* which is *true* by default to stay

*   [#1320](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1320/): Enhance SimplifyBooleanReturns checks
*   PMD exits with status `4` if any violations have been found. This behavior has been introduced to ease PMD
    integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

**New/Modified/Deprecated Rules:**

The following rules have been
<span style="border-radius: 0.25em; color: #fff; padding: 0.2em 0.6em 0.3em; display: inline; background-color: #5CB85C; font-size: 75%;">enhanced</span>
:

*   Language Java, ruleset design.xml: The rule "SimplifyBooleanReturns" now also marks methods where the else case is omitted and just a return.
    See also feature [#1320](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1320/).

The following rules are marked as
<span style="border-radius: 0.25em; color: #fff; padding: 0.2em 0.6em 0.3em; display: inline; background-color: #d9534f; font-size: 75%;">deprecated</span>
and will be removed with the next release of PMD.

*   Language Java, ruleset basic.xml: The following rules have been *moved into the `empty.xml` ruleset*. You'll need
    to enable the "empty" ruleset explicitly from now on, if you want to have these rules executed:

    EmptyCatchBlock, EmptyIfStatement, EmptyWhileStmt, EmptyTryBlock, EmptyFinallyBlock, EmptySwitchStatements,
    EmptySynchronizedBlock, EmptyStatementNotInLoop, EmptyInitializer, EmptyStatementBlock, EmptyStaticInitializer.

*   Language Java, ruleset basic.xml: The following rules have been *moved into the `unnecessary.xml` ruleset*. You'll need
    to enable the "unnecessary" ruleset explicitly from now on, if you want to have these rules executed:

    UnnecessaryConversionTemporary, UnnecessaryReturn, UnnecessaryFinalModifier, UselessOverridingMethod,
    UselessOperationOnImmutable, UnusedNullCheckInEquals, UselessParentheses.

*   Language Java, ruleset design.xml: The rule "UncommentedEmptyMethod" *has been renamed* to "UncommentedEmptyMethodBody".
    See also bug [#1283](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1283/).

**API Changes:**

*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Match.iterator()` now returns an iterator of the new type `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Mark` instead
    of TokenEntry. A `Mark` contains all the informations about each single duplication, including the TokenEntry via `Mark.getToken()`.
    This Mark is useful for reporting the correct line count for each duplication. Previously only one line count was available.
    As for some languages CPD can be instructed to ignore comments, the line count could be different in the different files
    for the same duplication.

*   pmd-test: The utility class `StreamUtil` is deprecated. Just use Apache Commons IO Utils instead.

## October 17, 2014 - 5.2.0:

**Modularization of the source code:**

The source code of pmd was undergoing a major restructuring. Each language is separated
out into its own module. This reduces the size of the artifacts significantly, if only
one language is needed. It also makes it easier, to add new languages as extensions.

Therefore, the maven coordinates needed to change. In order to just use pmd with java support, you'll need
the following two dependencies:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
        <artifactId>pmd-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
        <artifactId>pmd-java</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
    </dependency>

The binary package still contains all languages and can be used as usual. Have a look at
[the central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3Anet.sourceforge.pmd) for available modules.

**New Languages**

* CPD supports now [Go](https://golang.org/).

**Pull requests:**

* [#9](https://github.com/adangel/pmd/pull/9/): New rule: NoUnsanitizedJSPExpressionRule
* [#44](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/44/): Add GoLang support to CPD

**New/Modified Rules:**

* JSP - Basic ruleset:
    * NoUnsanitizedJSPExpression: Using unsanitized JSP expression can lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

* [#1244](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1244/): FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass and anonymous classes

**New/Modified Rules:**

  Ignore Field Declarations, that are initialized with anonymous class declarations. This property is enabled by default.
  See [feature #1244](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1244/).
* ShortClassName (ruleset java-naming) has a new property called `minimum`: Number of characters that are required
  as a minimum for a class name. By default, 5 characters are required - if the class name is shorter, a violation
  will be reported. See [feature #1232](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1232/).

**CPD Changes:**

- Command Line
    - Added option "--skip-lexical-errors" to skip files, which can't be tokenized
      due to invalid characters instead of aborting CPD. See also [bug 1178].
- Ant
    - New optional parameter "skipDuplicateFiles": Ignore multiple copies of files of the same name and length in
      comparison; defaults to "false".
      This was already a command line option, but now also available in in CPD's ant task.
    - New optional parameter "skipLexicalErros": Skip files which can't be tokenized due to invalid characters
      instead of aborting CPD; defaults to "false".

[bug 1178]: https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1178/


## February 11, 2014 - 5.1.0:

**New/Updated Languages:**

- Java 1.8 support added.
- PLSQL support added; thanks to Stuart Turton. See also http://pldoc.sourceforge.net/
- Apache Velocity support added; thanks to Andrey Utis. See also http://velocity.apache.org

**New/Updated Rulesets and Rules:**

- EcmaScript
    - Controversial ruleset, featuring AvoidWithStatement
    - UseBaseWithParseInt
- Java
    - GuardLogStatement
        - replace xpath implementation of GuardDebugLogging by GuardLogStatement (better perf)
    - CommentRequired
        - basic rule to check for existence for formal (javadoc) comments.
    - AvoidProtectedMethodInFinalClassNotExtending
        - rule to avoid protected methods in final classes that don't extend anything other than Object.
    - ConsecutiveAppendsShouldReuse
        - rule to encourage to reuse StringBuilder.append returned object for consecutive calls.
    - PositionLiteralsFirstInCaseInsensitiveComparisons
        - rule similar to PositionLiteralsFirstInComparisons, but for case insensitive comparisons (equalsIgnoreCase).
          Thanks to Larry Diamond
    - ConfusingTernary
        - new property "ignoreElseIf" to suppress this rule in case of if-else-if-else usage.
          See [feature 1161]: Confusing Ternary should skip else if statements (or have a property to do so)
    - FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass
        - new property "ignoreEnumDeclarations" which is enabled by default. This relaxes the rule, so
          that enums can be declared before fields and the rule is not triggered.

**CPD Changes:**
- Command Line
    - Added non-recursive option "--non-recursive" to not scan sub-directories
    - Added option "--exclude" to exclude specific files from being scanned (thanks to Delmas for patch #272)

    on each other (eg: multi-module Maven projects.). Thanks to David Golpira.

**Miscellaneous:**

- Upgrade to javacc 5.0 (see patch #1109 Patch to build with Javacc 5.0)

    PMD Command Line Changes:
      Improved command line interface (CLI) parsing using JCommander.
      Note: this breaks compatibility, but should be easy to fix.
      With "-d" you specify nowtThe source files / source directory to be scanned.
      With "-f" you select the report format (like text, html, ...)
      With "-R" you select the rulesets to be used.
      Example: pmd -d c:\data\pmd\pmd\test-data\Unused1.java -f xml -R rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml

    Improved JSP parser to be less strict with not valid XML documents (like HTML). Thanks to Victor Bucutea.
    Fixed bgastviewer not working. Thanks to Victor Bucutea.
    Improved CPD: Support in CPD for IgnoreAnnotations and SuppressWarnings("CPD-START"). Thanks to Matthew Short.

    Fixed bug 3175710: NPE in InsufficientStringBufferDeclaration

    CPD:
    - Exit with status code 4 when CPD detects code duplication (Patch ID: 3497021)

## January 31, 2012 - 5.0-alpha:

    This version of PMD breaks API compatibility with prior versions of PMD, as well
    as RuleSet XML compatibility. Also the maven coordinates (groupId) have been changed.
    The decision to break compatibility, allows PMD
    internals and code organization to be improved to better handle additional
    languages.  This opportunity was used to remove depreciated APIs, and beat up
    any code which has thumbed its nose at the developers over the years. ;)

    The following is relatively complete list of the major changes (this may not be
    100% accurate, see actual source code when in doubt):

    Fixed bug (no number) - Fixed UseStringBufferLengthRule only worked once per class
    All StringBuffer-related rules now also catch StringBuilder-related issues in the same way

    New features:

    New Language 'ecmascript' added, for writing XPathRule and Java Rules against ECMAScript/JavaScript documents (must be standalone, not embedded in HTML).  Many thanks to Rhino!
    New Language 'xml' added, for writing XPathRules against XML documents
    New Language 'xsl' added, as a derivative from XML.
    Rules can now define a 'violationSuppressRegex' property to universally suppress violations with messages matching the given regular expression
    Rules can now define a 'violationSuppressXPath' property to universally suppress violations on nodes which match the given relative XPath expression
    Rules are now directly associated with a corresponding Language, and a can also be associated with a specific Language Version range if desired.
    Rules can now be flagged with deprecated='true' in the RuleSet XML to allow the PMD Project to indicate a Rule (1) is scheduled for removal, (2) has been removed, or (3) has been renamed/moved.
    XPathRules can now query using XPath 2.0 with 'version=2.0"', or XPath 2.0 in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode using 'version="1.0 compatibility"'.  Many thanks to Saxon!
    Rules can now use property values in messages, for example ${propertyName} will expand to the value of the 'propertyName' property on the Rule.
    Rules can now use violation specific values in messages, specifically ${variableName}, ${methodName}, ${className}, ${packageName}.
    New XPath function 'getCommentOn' can be used to search for strings in comments - Thanks to Andy Throgmorton

## October 19, 2004 - 2.0:

    New rules: InstantiationToGetClass, IdempotentOperationsRule, SuspiciousEqualsMethodName, SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale, JUnitTestsShouldContainAssertsRule, SuspiciousConstantFieldName, ImmutableFieldRule, MoreThanOneLoggerRule, LoggerIsNotStaticFinalRule, UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
    Applied patch in RFE 992576 - Enhancements to VariableNamingConventionsRule
    Implemented RFE 995910 - The HTML report can now include links to HTMLlized source code - for example, the HTML generated by JXR.
    Implemented RFE 665824 - PMD now ignores rule violations in lines containing the string 'NOPMD'.
    Fixed bug in SimplifyBooleanExpressions - now it catches more cases.
    Fixed bugs in AvoidDuplicateLiterals - now it ignores small duplicate literals, its message is more helpful, and it catches more cases.
    Fixed bug 997893 - UnusedPrivateField now detects assignments to members of private fields as a usage.
    Fixed bug 1020199 - UnusedLocalVariable no longer flags arrays as unused if an assignment is made to an array slot.
    Fixed bug 1027133 - Now ExceptionSignatureDeclaration skips certain JUnit framework methods.
    Fixed bug 1008548 - The 'favorites' ruleset no longer contains a broken reference.
    Fixed bug 1045583 - UnusedModifier now correctly handles anonymous inner classes within interface field declarations.
    Partially fixed bug 998122 - CloseConnectionRule now checks for imports of java.sql before reporting a rule violation.
    Applied patch 1001694 - Now PMD can process zip/jar files of source code.
    Applied patch 1032927 - The XML report now includes the rule priority.
    Added data flow analysis facade from Raik Schroeder.
    Added two new optional attributes to rule definitions - symboltable and dfa.  These allow the symbol table and DFA facades to be configured on a rule-by-rule basis.  Note that if your rule needs the symbol table; you'll need to add symboltable="true" to your rule definition.  FWIW, this also results in about a 5% speedup for rules that don't need either layer.
    Added a "logging" ruleset - thanks to Miguel Griffa for the code!
    Enhanced the ASTViewer - and renamed it 'Designer' - to display data flows.
    Moved development environment to Maven 1.0.
    Moved development environment to Ant 1.6.2.  This is nice because using the new JUnit task attribute "forkmode='perBatch'" cuts test runtime from 90 seconds to 7 seconds.  Sweet.
    MethodWithSameNameAsEnclosingClass now reports a more helpful line number.

    Moved LooseCoupling from design.xml to coupling.xml.
    Some minor performance optimizations - removed some unnecessary casts from the grammar, simplified some XPath rules.
    Postfix expressions (i.e., x++) are now available in the grammar.  To access them, search for StatementExpressions with an image of "++" or "--" - i.e., in XPath, //StatementExpression[@Image="++"].  This is an odd hack and hopefully will get cleared up later.
    Ant task and CLI now used BufferedInputStreams.
    Converted AtLeastOneConstructor rule from Java code to XPath.
    Implemented RFE 743460: The XML report now contains the ruleset name.

## May 19, 2004 - 1.8:

    New rules: ExceptionAsFlowControlRule, BadComparisonRule, AvoidThrowingCertainExceptionTypesRule, AvoidCatchingNPERule, OptimizableToArrayCallRule
    Major grammar changes - lots of new node types added, many superfluous nodes removed from the runtime AST.  Bug 786611 - http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=786611&group_id=56262&atid=479921 - explains it a bit more.
