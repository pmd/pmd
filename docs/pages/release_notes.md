### New and noteworthy

#### New rules

This release ships with 1 new Java rule.

*   {% rule java/errorprone/ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull %} suggests returning empty collections / arrays
    instead of null.

```xml
    <rule ref="category/java/errorprone.xml/ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull" />
```

   The rule is part of the quickstart.xml ruleset.

#### Renamed rules

*   The Java rule {% rule java/errorprone/MissingBreakInSwitch %} has been renamed to
    {% rule java/errorprone/ImplicitSwitchFallThrough %} (category error prone) to better reflect the rule's
    purpose: The rule finds implicit fall-through cases in switch statements, which are most
    likely unexpected. The old rule name described only one way how to avoid a fall-through,
    namely using `break` but `continue`, `throw` and `return` avoid a fall-through
    as well. This enables us to improve this rule in the future.

#### Deprecated rules

The rule {% rule java/errorprone/ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull %} is deprecated and removed from
the quickstart ruleset, as the new rule {% rule java/errorprone/ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull %}
supersedes it.
