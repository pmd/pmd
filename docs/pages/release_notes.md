in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### 🚀️ New and noteworthy

### 🌟️ New and Changed Rules
#### New Rules
* The new Java rule {% rule java/errorprone/WrongTestAnnotation %} detects when test annotations from the wrong
  testing framework (JUnit 4, JUnit Jupiter, or TestNG) are used in your code, preventing tests from being silently
  skipped due to framework mismatches. This helps avoid the silent failure where tests compile but don't execute
  because the test runner doesn't recognize the annotation.

### 🐛️ Fixed Issues
* java-bestpractices
  * [#6692](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6692): \[java] ForLoopCanBeForeach: inconsistent detection between i += 1 and i = i + 1 update forms
* java-codestyle
  * [#6239](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6239): \[java] UseDiamondOperator: False positive with Guice TypeLiteral
* java-errorprone
  * [#2846](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2846): \[java] New Rule: WrongTestAnnotation
  * [#6743](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6743): \[java] CloseResource: False positive for closeable initialized with (T) null
