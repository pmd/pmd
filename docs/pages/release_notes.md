### 🚀 New and noteworthy

#### ✨ New Rules

This release brings several new rules for both Java and Apex. Please try them out
and submit feedback on [our issue tracker](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues)!

* The new apex rule {% rule apex/codestyle/AnnotationsNamingConventions %} enforces that annotations
  are used consistently in PascalCase.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Apex.
* The new java rule {% rule java/codestyle/TypeParameterNamingConventions %} replaces the now deprecated rule
  GenericsNaming. The new rule is configurable and checks for naming conventions of type parameters in
  generic types and methods. It can be configured via a regular expression.  
  By default, this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (single uppercase letter).  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.
* The new java rule {% rule java/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashCodeOnComparable %} finds missing
  `hashCode()` and/or `equals()` methods on types that implement `Comparable`. This is important if
  instances of these classes are used in collections. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior in sets
  which then do not conform to the `Set` interface. While the `Set` interface relies on
  `equals()` to determine object equality, sorted sets like `TreeSet` use
  `compareTo()` instead. The same issue can arise when such objects are used
  as keys in sorted maps.  
  This rule is very similar to {% rule java/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode %} which has always been
  skipping `Comparable` and only reports if one of the two methods is missing. The new rule will also report,
  if both methods (hashCode and equals) are missing.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.
* The new java rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessPureMethodCall %} finds method calls of pure methods
  whose result is not used. Ignoring the result of such method calls is likely as mistake as pure
  methods are side effect free.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.
* The new java rule {% rule java/bestpractices/RelianceOnDefaultCharset %} finds method calls that
  depend on the JVM's default charset. Using these method without specifying the charset explicitly
  can lead to unexpected behavior on different platforms.
* Thew new java rule {% rule java/codestyle/VariableCanBeInlined %} finds local variables that are
  immediately returned or thrown. This rule replaces the old rule {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn %}
  which only considered return statements. The new rule also finds unnecessary local variables
  before throw statements.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.
* The new java rule {% rule java/errorprone/CollectionTypeMismatch %} detects calls to
  collection methods where we suspect the types are incompatible. This happens for instance
  when you try to remove a `String` from a `Collection<Integer>`: although it is allowed
  to write this because `remove` takes an `Object` parameter, it is most likely a mistake.

#### Deprecated Rules
* The java rule {% rule java/codestyle/GenericsNaming %} has been deprecated for removal in favor
  of the new rule {% rule java/codestyle/TypeParameterNamingConventions %}.
* The java rule {% rule java/errorprone/AvoidLosingExceptionInformation %} has been deprecated for removal
  in favor of the new rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessPureMethodCall %}.
* The java rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessOperationOnImmutable %} has been deprecated for removal
  in favor of the new rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessPureMethodCall %}.
* The java rule {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn %} has been deprecated for removal
  in favor of the new rule {% rule java/codestyle/VariableCanBeInlined %}.

### 🚨 API Changes

#### Rule Test Schema
When executing rule tests, the rule test XML file will be validated against the schema and the tests will fail
if the XML file is invalid.

There was a small bug in the schema around verifying suppressed violations: If a test wanted to verify, that there
are _no_ suppressed violations, then this was not possible. Now the `<expected-suppression>` element may be
empty. This is available in version 1.1.1 of the schema.
See [Testing your rules]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_extending_testing.html) for more information.

#### Deprecations
* test
  * The method {%jdoc !!test::test.lang.rule.AbstractRuleSetFactoryTest#hasCorrectEncoding(java.lang.String) %} will be removed.
    PMD has the rule {% rule xml/bestpractices/MissingEncoding %} for XML files that should be used instead.
