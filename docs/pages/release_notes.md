This allows to use links e.g. [Basic CLI usage]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_installation.html) that work both
in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### 🚀️ New and noteworthy

### 🌟️ New and Changed Rules
#### New Rules
* The new Java rule {% rule java/design/PublicMemberInNonPublicType %} detects public members (such as methods 
  or fields) within non-public types. Non-public types should not declare public members, as their effective
  visibility is limited, and using the `public` modifier can create confusion.

### 🐛️ Fixed Issues
* java-design
  * [#6231](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6231): \[java] New Rule: PublicMemberInNonPublicType
