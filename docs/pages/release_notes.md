This allows to use links e.g. [Basic CLI usage]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_installation.html) that work both
in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### 🚀 New and noteworthy

#### PMD CLI now uses threaded execution by default

In the PMD CLI, the `--threads` (`-t`) option can now accept a thread
count given relative to the number of cores of the machine. For instance,
it is now possible to write `-t 1C` to spawn one thread per core, or `-t 0.5C`
to spawn one thread for every other core.

The thread count option now defaults to `1C`, meaning parallel execution
is used by default. You can disable this by using `-t 1`.

#### Migrating to Central Publisher Portal

We've now migrated to [Central Publisher Portal](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-guide/).
Snapshots of PMD are still available, however the repository URL changed. To consume these with maven, you can
use the following snippet:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <name>Central Portal Snapshots</name>
    <id>central-portal-snapshots</id>
    <url>https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Releases of PMD are available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/) as before without change.
