### New and noteworthy

### Fixed Issues

*   apex
    *   [#3201](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3201): \[apex] ApexCRUDViolation doesn't report Database class DMLs, inline no-arg object instantiations and inline list initialization
    *   [#3329](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3329): \[apex] ApexCRUDViolation doesn't report SOQL for loops
*   core
    *   [#3377](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3377): \[core] NPE when specifying report file in current directory in PMD CLI
    *   [#3387](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3387): \[core] CPD should avoid unnecessary copies when running with --skip-lexical-errors

### API Changes

#### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

*   The inner class {% jdoc !!core::cpd.TokenEntry.State %} is considered to be internal API.
    It will probably be moved away with PMD 7.
