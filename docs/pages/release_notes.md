### New and noteworthy

#### New rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/DetachedTestCase" %} (`java-errorprone`) searches for public
    methods in test classes, which are not annotated with `@Test`. These methods might be test cases where
    the annotation has been forgotten. Because of that those test cases are never executed.

### Fixed Issues

### API Changes

### External Contributions

*   [#1706](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/1706): \[java] Add DetachedTestCase rule - [David Burström](https://github.com/davidburstromspotify)
