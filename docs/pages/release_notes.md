### API Changes

#### Deprecated API

Some API deprecations were performed in core PMD classes, to improve compatibility with PMD 7.
- {% jdoc core::Report %}: the constructor and other construction methods like addViolation or createReport
- {% jdoc core::RuleContext %}: all constructors, getters and setters. A new set
of stable methods, matching those in PMD 7, was added to replace the `addViolation`
overloads of {% jdoc core::lang.rule.AbstractRule %}. In PMD 7, `RuleContext` will
be the API to report violations, and it can already be used as such in PMD 6.
- The field {% jdoc core::PMD#configuration %} is unused and will be removed.

#### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

- {% jdoc core::RuleSet %}: methods that serve to apply rules, including `apply`, `start`, `end`, `removeDysfunctionalRules`
- {% jdoc !!core::renderers.AbstractAccumulatingRenderer#renderFileReport(Report) %} is internal API
  and should not be overridden in own renderers.

#### Changed API

It is now forbidden to report a violation:
- With a `null` node
- With a `null` message
- With a `null` set of format arguments (prefer a zero-length array)

Note that the message is set from the XML rule declaration, so this is only relevant
if you instantiate rules manually.

{% jdoc core::RuleContext %} now requires setting the current rule before calling
{% jdoc core::Rule#apply(java.util.List, core::RuleContext) %}. This is
done automatically by `RuleSet#apply` and such. Creating and configuring a
`RuleContext` manually is strongly advised against, as the lifecycle of `RuleContext`
will change drastically in PMD 7.
