This allows to use links e.g. [Basic CLI usage]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_installation.html) that work both
in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### 🚀️ New and noteworthy

#### CPD performance improvements

CPD has been refactored internally to be more efficient. It now uses less
memory (as much as 10 times less on some benchmarks), and can process source
files in parallel for much faster results. CPD now supports the `--threads`
(`-t`) option. The default is `1C`, meaning 1 thread per core.

Note: if you have written you own CpdLexer implementations:
- Make sure they are thread-safe, as they can now be used in a threaded context.
- You are advised to use the new overloads of {% jdoc core::cpd.TokenFactory#recordToken(java.lang.String,int,int) %}.
These are more memory-efficient as the node coordinates require only two ints
to be saved instead of four.
