in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### 🚀 New and noteworthy

#### ✨ New Rules
* The new java rule {% rule java/codestyle/TypeParameterNamingConventions %} replaces the now deprecated rule
  GenericsNaming. The new rule is configurable and checks for naming conventions of type parameters in
  generic types and methods. It can be configured via a regular expression.  
  By default, this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (single uppercase letter).  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.
* The new java rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessPureMethodCall %} finds method calls of pure methods
  whose result is not used. Ignoring the result of such method calls is likely as mistake as pure
  methods are side effect free.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.

#### Deprecated Rules
* The java rule {% rule java/codestyle/GenericsNaming %} has been deprecated for removal in favor
  of the new rule {% rule java/codestyle/TypeParameterNamingConventions %}.
* The java rule {% rule java/errorprone/AvoidLosingExceptionInformation %} has been deprecated for removal
  in favor of the new rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessPureMethodCall %}.
* The java rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessOperationOnImmutable %} has been deprecated for removal
  in favor of the new rule {% rule java/errorprone/UselessPureMethodCall %}.
