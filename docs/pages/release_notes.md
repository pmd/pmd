### New and noteworthy

#### Improved Incremental Analysis

[Incremental Analysis](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.36.0/pmd_userdocs_incremental_analysis.html) has long helped
our users obtain faster analysis results, however, its implementation tended to be too cautious in detecting
changes to the runtime and type resolution classpaths, producing more cache invalidations than necessary.
We have now improved the heuristics to remove several bogus invalidations, and slightly sped up the cache
usage along the way.

PMD will now ignore:

*   Non class files in classpath and jar / zip files being referenced.
*   Changes to the order of file entries within a jar / zip
*   Changes to file metadata within jar / zip (ie: creation and modification time,
    significant in multi-module / composite build projects where lateral artifacts are frequently recreated)

#### New rules

*   The new Apex rule {% rule apex/performance/AvoidDebugStatements %} finds usages of `System.debug` calls.
    Debug statements contribute to longer transactions and consume Apex CPU time even when debug logs are not
    being captured.
    You can try out this rule like so:

```xml
    <rule ref="category/apex/performance.xml/AvoidDebugStatements" />
```

*   The new Apex rule {% rule "apex/errorprone/InaccessibleAuraEnabledGetter" %} checks that an `AuraEnabled`
    getter is public or global. This is necessary if it is referenced in Lightning components.
    You can try out this rule like so:

```xml
    <rule ref="category/apex/errorprone.xml/InaccessibleAuraEnabledGetter" />
```

#### Renamed rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/BadComparison" %} has been renamed to
    {% rule "java/errorprone/ComparisonWithNaN" %} to better reflect what the rule actually detects.
    It now considers usages of `Double.NaN` or `Float.NaN` in more cases and fixes false negatives.
