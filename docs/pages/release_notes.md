This allows to use links e.g. [Basic CLI usage]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_installation.html) that work both
in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### 🚀️ New and noteworthy

### 🌟️ New and Changed Rules
#### New Rules
* The new Java rule {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryInterfaceDeclaration %} detects classes that
  implement interfaces that are already implemented by its superclass, and interfaces
  that extend other interfaces already declared by their superinterfaces.  
  These declarations are redundant and can be removed to simplify the code.

#### Changed Rules
* The rule {% rule java/errorprone/CloseResource %} introduces a new property, `allowedResourceMethodPatterns`,
  which lets you specify method invocation patterns whose return values are resources managed externally.
  This is useful for ignoring managed resources - for example, `Reader`/`Writer` instances obtained from
  `HttpServletRequest`/`HttpServletResponse` - because the servlet container, not application code,
  is responsible for closing them. By default, the rule ignores `InputStream`/`OutputStream`/`Reader`/`Writer`
  resources returned by methods on `(Http)ServletRequest` and `(Http)ServletResponse`
  (both `javax.servlet` and `jakarta.servlet`).

### 🐛️ Fixed Issues
* core
  * [#6471](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6471): \[core] BaseAntlrTerminalNode should return type instead of index for getTokenKind()
* doc
  * [#6396](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/6396): \[doc] Mention test-pmd-tool as alternative for testing
* java-bestpractices
  * [#6431](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6431): \[java] UnitTestShouldIncludeAssert: False positive with SoftAssertionsExtension on parent/grandparent classes
* java-codestyle
  * [#6458](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/6458): \[java] New Rule: UnnecessaryInterfaceDeclaration
* java-errorprone
  * [#6436](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/6436): \[java] CloseResource: Allow to ignore managed resources

### 🚨️ API Changes

#### Deprecations
* core
  * {%jdoc core::renderers.CodeClimateIssue %}: This class is an implementation detail of
    {%jdoc core::renderers.CodeClimateRenderer %}. It will be internalized in a future release.
* visualforce
  * {%jdoc visualforce::lang.visualforce.DataType %}. The enum constants have been renamed to follow Java naming
    conventions. The old enum constants are deprecated and should no longer be used.  
    The method {%jdoc !!visualforce::lang.visualforce.DataType#fromString(java.lang.String) %} will return the new
    enum constants.  
    Use {%jdoc !!visualforce::lang.visualforce.DataType#fieldTypeNameOf() %} to get the original field type name.
