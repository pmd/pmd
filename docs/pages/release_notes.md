We're excited to bring you the next major version of PMD!

Since this is a big release, we provide here only a concise version of the release notes. We prepared a separate
page with the full [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7.0.0]({{ baseurl }}pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html).

<div style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: .25rem; padding: .75rem 1.25rem;" role="alert">
<strong>‚ÑπÔ∏è Release Candidates</strong>
<p>PMD 7.0.0 is finally almost ready. In order to gather feedback, we are going to ship a couple of release candidates.
These are officially available on GitHub and Maven Central and can be used as usual (e.g. as a dependency).
We encourage you to try out the new features, but keep in mind that we may introduce API breaking changes between
the release candidates. It should be stable enough if you don't use custom rules.</p>

<p>We have still some tasks planned for the next release candidates.
You can see the progress in <a href="https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3898">PMD 7 Tracking Issue #3898</a>.</p>

<p>If you find any problem or difficulty while updating from PMD 6, please provide feedback via our
<a href="https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/new/choose">issue tracker</a>. That way we can improve the experience
for all.</p>

  `maximumLanguageVersion` attributes.

#### Changed: CPP can now ignore identifiers in sequences (CPD)

* new command line option for CPD: `--ignore-sequences`.
* This option is used for CPP only: with the already existing option `--ignore-literal-sequences`, only
  literals were ignored. The new option additional ignores identifiers as well in sequences.
* See [PR #4470](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4470) for details.

### üåü New and changed rules

#### New Rules

**Apex**
* {% rule apex/design/UnusedMethod %} finds unused methods in your code.

**Java**
* {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryBoxing %} reports boxing and unboxing conversions that may be made implicit.

**Kotlin**
* {% rule kotlin/bestpractices/FunctionNameTooShort %}
* {% rule kotlin/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode %}

**Swift**
* {% rule swift/bestpractices/ProhibitedInterfaceBuilder %}
* {% rule swift/bestpractices/UnavailableFunction %}
* {% rule swift/errorprone/ForceCast %}
* {% rule swift/errorprone/ForceTry %}

#### Changed Rules

**General changes**

* All statistical rules (like ExcessiveClassLength, ExcessiveParameterList) have been simplified and unified.
  The properties `topscore` and `sigma` have been removed. The property `minimum` is still there, however the type is not
  a decimal number anymore but has been changed to an integer. This affects rules in the languages Apex, Java, PLSQL
  and Velocity Template Language (vm):
    * Apex: {% rule apex/design/ExcessiveClassLength %}, {% rule apex/design/ExcessiveParameterList %},
      {% rule apex/design/ExcessivePublicCount %}, {% rule apex/design/NcssConstructorCount %},
      {% rule apex/design/NcssMethodCount %}, {% rule apex/design/NcssTypeCount %}
    * Java: {% rule java/design/ExcessiveImports %}, {% rule java/design/ExcessiveParameterList %},
      {% rule java/design/ExcessivePublicCount %}, {% rule java/design/SwitchDensity %}
    * PLSQL: {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveMethodLength %}, {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveObjectLength %},
      {% rule plsql/design/ExcessivePackageBodyLength %}, {% rule plsql/design/ExcessivePackageSpecificationLength %},
      {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveParameterList %}, {% rule plsql/design/ExcessiveTypeLength %},
      {% rule plsql/design/NcssMethodCount %}, {% rule plsql/design/NcssObjectCount %},
      {% rule plsql/design/NPathComplexity %}
    * VM: {% rule vm/design/ExcessiveTemplateLength %}

* The general property `violationSuppressXPath` which is available for all rules to
  [suppress warnings]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_suppressing_warnings.html) now uses XPath version 3.1 by default.
  This version of the XPath language is mostly identical to XPath 2.0. In PMD 6, XPath 1.0 has been used.
  If you upgrade from PMD 6, you need to verify your `violationSuppressXPath` properties.

**Apex General changes**

* The properties `cc_categories`, `cc_remediation_points_multiplier`, `cc_block_highlighting` have been removed
  from all rules. These properties have been deprecated since PMD 6.13.0.
  See [issue #1648](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1648) for more details.

**Java General changes**

* Violations reported on methods or classes previously reported the line range of the entire method
  or class. With PMD 7.0.0, the reported location is now just the identifier of the method or class.
  This affects various rules, e.g. {% rule java/design/CognitiveComplexity %}.

  The report location is controlled by the overrides of the method {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node#getReportLocation() %}
  in different node types.

  See [issue #4439](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4439) and [issue #730](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/730)
  for more details.

**Java Best Practices**

* {% rule java/bestpractices/ArrayIsStoredDirectly %}: Violations are now reported on the assignment and not
  anymore on the formal parameter. The reported line numbers will probably move.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/AvoidReassigningLoopVariables %}: This rule might not report anymore all
  reassignments of the control variable in for-loops when the property `forReassign` is set to `skip`.
  See [issue #4500](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4500) for more details.
* {% rule java/bestpractices/LooseCoupling %}: The rule has a new property to allow some types to be coupled
  to (`allowedTypes`).
* {% rule java/bestpractices/UnusedLocalVariable %}: This rule has some important false-negatives fixed
  and finds many more cases now. For details see issues [#2130](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2130),
  [#4516](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4516), and [#4517](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4517).

**Java Codestyle**

* {% rule java/codestyle/MethodNamingConventions %}: The property `checkNativeMethods` has been removed. The
  property was deprecated since PMD 6.3.0. Use the property `nativePattern` to control whether native methods
  should be considered or not.
* {% rule java/codestyle/ShortVariable %}: This rule now also reports short enum constant names.
* {% rule java/codestyle/UseDiamondOperator %}: The property `java7Compatibility` has been removed. The rule now
  handles Java 7 properly without a property.
* {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryFullyQualifiedName %}: The rule has two new properties,
  to selectively disable reporting on static field and method qualifiers. The rule also has been improved
  to be more precise.
* {% rule java/codestyle/UselessParentheses %}: The rule has two new properties which control how strict
  the rule should be applied. With `ignoreClarifying` (default: true) parentheses that are strictly speaking
  not necessary are allowed, if they separate expressions of different precedence.
  The other property `ignoreBalancing` (default: true) is similar, in that it allows parentheses that help
  reading and understanding the expressions.

**Java Design**

* {% rule java/design/CyclomaticComplexity %}: The property `reportLevel` has been removed. The property was
  deprecated since PMD 6.0.0. The report level can now be configured separated for classes and methods using
  `classReportLevel` and `methodReportLevel` instead.
* {% rule java/design/ImmutableField %}: The property `ignoredAnnotations` has been removed. The property was
  deprecated since PMD 6.52.0.
* {% rule java/design/LawOfDemeter %}: The rule has a new property `trustRadius`. This defines the maximum degree
  of trusted data. The default of 1 is the most restrictive.
* {% rule java/design/NPathComplexity %}: The property `minimum` has been removed. It was deprecated since PMD 6.0.0.
  Use the property `reportLevel` instead.
* {% rule java/design/SingularField %}: The properties `checkInnerClasses` and `disallowNotAssignment` have been removed.
  The rule is now more precise and will check these cases properly.
* {% rule java/design/UseUtilityClass %}: The property `ignoredAnnotations` has been removed.

**Java Documentation**

* {% rule java/documentation/CommentContent %}: The properties `caseSensitive` and `disallowedTerms` are removed. The
  new property `forbiddenRegex` can be used now to define the disallowed terms with a single regular
  expression.
* {% rule java/documentation/CommentRequired %}:
    * Overridden methods are now detected even without the `@Override`
      annotation. This is relevant for the property `methodWithOverrideCommentRequirement`.
      See also [pull request #3757](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/3757).
    * Elements in annotation types are now detected as well. This might lead to an increased number of violations
      for missing public method comments.
* {% rule java/documentation/CommentSize %}: When determining the line-length of a comment, the leading comment
  prefix markers (e.g. `*` or `//`) are ignored and don't add up to the line-length.
  See also [pull request #4369](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4369).

**Java Error Prone**

* {% rule java/errorprone/AvoidDuplicateLiterals %}: The property `exceptionfile` has been removed. The property was
  deprecated since PMD 6.10.0. Use the property `exceptionList` instead.
* {% rule java/errorprone/DontImportSun %}: `sun.misc.Signal` is not special-cased anymore.
* {% rule java/errorprone/EmptyCatchBlock %}: `CloneNotSupportedException` and `InterruptedException` are not
  special-cased anymore. Rename the exception parameter to `ignored` to ignore them.
* {% rule java/errorprone/ImplicitSwitchFallThrough %}: Violations are now reported on the case statements
  rather than on the switch statements. This is more accurate but might result in more violations now.

#### Removed Rules

Many rules, that were previously deprecated have been finally removed.
See [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7]({{ baseurl }}pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html) for the complete list.

### üö® API

The API of PMD has been growing over the years and needed some cleanup. The goal is, to
have a clear separation between a well-defined API and the implementation, which is internal.
This should help us in future development.

Also, there are some improvement and changes in different areas. For the detailed description
of the changes listed here, see [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7]({{ baseurl }}pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html).

* Miscellaneous smaller changes and cleanups
* XPath 3.1 support for XPath-based rules
* Node stream API for AST traversal
* Metrics framework
* Testing framework
* Language Lifecycle and Language Properties
