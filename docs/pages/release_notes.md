### 🚀️ New and noteworthy
#### Updated ANTLR library to 4.13.2
We have updated the ANTLR library (parser generator) from 4.9.3 to the latest version 4.13.2,
in order to be able to use the latest version of Apex parser library.

This is an incompatible update: In case you use custom language modules based on ANTLR, you
need to make sure to regenerate all of your lexers and parsers with the new ANTLR version.

For the ANTLR based language modules, that PMD ships (kotlin and swift and various CPD modules),
this is already done.

### 🌟️ New and Changed Rules
#### New Rules
* The new Java rule {% rule java/errorprone/JUnit5TestNoPrivateModifier %} find JUnit test classes and
  methods that are private. Test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods are not required to be public,
  but they must not be private. Otherwise, they won’t be found by the test framework.
* The new Java rule {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryBlock %} reports blocks that are unnecessary as
  they don't introduce a new scope. This rule helps simplify code structure by identifying and flagging
  redundant blocks that can make code harder to read and may be misleading.
* The new Java rule {% rule java/codestyle/VariableDeclarationUsageDistance %} flags local variables that are declared
  far from their usage, which can make code harder to read. The rule has a property `maxDistance` that allows to
  configure the maximum allowed distance between declaration and usage.
* The new Java rule {% rule java/bestpractices/AssertStatementInTest %} detects usages of `assert` statement in tests.
  These should be replaced by framework assertion methods such as `assertEquals`.
  Such methods provide better error messages and make test behave correctly when running without `-ea`.

#### Changed Rules
* The rule {% rule java/codestyle/OnlyOneReturn %} has a new property `allowGuardIfs`. When this property is
  true, then guard ifs at the beginning of a method are allowed their return statements don't count.
* We are continuously working to improve the precision of violation reporting for various rules.
  The goal is to ensure that rules report issues on the correct line and highlight only the relevant lines.
  For example, instead of flagging an entire class declaration (including its body), we now generally report only
  the class name. For more details, see [[java] Single Line Warnings #730](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/730)
  and [[java] Review reported locations of rules #3769](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3769). While this effort
  is still ongoing, the following Java rules have been updated in this release:
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod %}
  * {% rule java/design/AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod %}
  * {% rule java/codestyle/AtLeastOneConstructor %}
  * {% rule java/codestyle/AvoidDollarSigns %}
  * {% rule java/errorprone/AvoidCatchingGenericException %}
  * {% rule java/multithreading/AvoidSynchronizedStatement %} (now reports only on synchronized keyword and not the whole synchronized block)
  * {% rule java/codestyle/ClassNamingConventions %}
  * {% rule java/design/ClassWithOnlyPrivateConstructorsShouldBeFinal %}
  * {% rule java/codestyle/CommentDefaultAccessModifier %}
  * {% rule java/documentation/CommentRequired %}
  * {% rule java/design/CouplingBetweenObjects %} (now reports only on class identifier and not whole compilation unit anymore)
  * {% rule java/design/CyclomaticComplexity %}
  * {% rule java/design/DataClass %}
  * {% rule java/design/ExcessiveImports %} (now reports only on imports and not the whole compilation unit anymore)
  * {% rule java/design/ExcessiveParameterList %}
  * {% rule java/design/ExcessivePublicCount %}
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/ExhaustiveSwitchHasDefault %} (now reports only on switch keyword and not the whole switch block)
  * {% rule java/design/GodClass %}
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/ImplicitFunctionalInterface %}
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/JUnit5TestShouldBePackagePrivate %}
  * {% rule java/codestyle/LocalHomeNamingConvention %}
  * {% rule java/codestyle/LocalInterfaceSessionNamingConvention %}
  * {% rule java/errorprone/MissingSerialVersionUID %}
  * {% rule java/errorprone/MissingStaticMethodInNonInstantiatableClass %}
  * {% rule java/design/NcssCount %}
  * {% rule java/bestpractices/NonExhaustiveSwitch %} (now reports only on switch keyword and not the whole switch block)
  * {% rule java/codestyle/NoPackage %}
  * {% rule java/design/PublicMemberInNonPublicType %}
  * {% rule java/codestyle/ShortClassName %}
  * {% rule java/errorprone/SingleMethodSingleton %}
  * {% rule java/design/SwitchDensity %} (now reports only on switch keyword and not the whole switch block)
  * {% rule java/errorprone/TestClassWithoutTestCases %}
  * {% rule java/performance/TooFewBranchesForSwitch %} (now reports only on switch keyword and not the whole switch block)
  * {% rule java/design/TooManyFields %} (now reports only on class identifier and not the whole class body anymore)
  * {% rule java/design/TooManyMethods %} (now reports only on class identifier and not the whole class body anymore)
  * {% rule java/codestyle/TooManyStaticImports %} (now reports only on the first static import and not the whole compilation unit anymore)
  * {% rule java/codestyle/UnnecessaryModifier %}
  * {% rule java/design/UseUtilityClass %}
