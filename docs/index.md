## ðŸ’¡ Overview

<!--  You can link to an individual panel, the id is determined from the title of the panel -->
<!--  See custom/shuffle_panel.html for the details -->

**PMD** is a static source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like
unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and
so forth. It's mainly concerned with **Java and Apex**, but **supports 16 other
languages**.

PMD features many **built-in checks** (in PMD lingo, *rules*), which are documented
for each language in our [Rule references](#shuffle-panel-rule-references). We
also support an extensive API to [**write your own rules**](#shuffle-panel-writing-rules),
which you can do either in Java or as a self-contained XPath query.

PMD is most useful when **integrated into your build process**. It can then be
used as a quality gate, to enforce a coding standard for your codebase. Among other
things, PMD can be run:
* As a [Maven goal](pmd_userdocs_tools_maven.html)
* As an [Ant task](pmd_userdocs_tools_ant.html)
* As a [Gradle task](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/pmd_plugin.html)
* From [command-line](pmd_userdocs_installation.html#running-pmd-via-command-line)

**CPD**, the **copy-paste detector**, is also distributed with PMD. You can also use it
in a variety of ways, which are [documented here](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html).

## ðŸ’¾ Download

The latest release of PMD can be downloaded from our [Github releases page](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases/latest).

The Logo is available from the [Logo Project Page](pmd_projectdocs_logo.html).
