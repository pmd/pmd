/**
 * Represents one of the stages applying on the AST
 * after parsing is done. Each of these stages implicitly
 * depends on the parser stage.
 *
 * <p>An analysis on a file goes through the following stages:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> Parsing stage: taking the source and configuration, and returning an AST
 *     <li> Language-specific AST visits: sequence of stages specific to each language.
 *          Each stage performs side effects on the AST, e.g. to resolve such things as comments,
 *          types, DFA graph, etc.
 *     <li> Rulechain application: all rulechain rules are run on the final AST
 *     <li> Rule application: other rules are run
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These steps are run on each file during the analysis, unless the cache entry of the file is up-to-date.
 * They're all run sequentially by the same thread. Rule application performs side-effects on the Report,
 * which is rendered after all files have been processed.
 *
 * <p>Parsing and rule[chain] application stages are considered special and are handled differently for now.
 * A {@link LanguageVersionHandler} is responsible for listing all available {@link AstProcessingStage}s
 * (see {@link LanguageVersionHandler#getProcessingStages()}). The actual set of stages that will get executed
 * for a run is the union of the dependencies of the rules in the run {@link RuleSets}.
 *
 * <p>Additional doc, to be moved elsewhere probably:
 * <p>PMD's execution goes through other more global stages (not sure about the exact order):
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Rule loading: creates a {@link RuleSets} from the ruleset files
 *   <li> Cache loading: loads the cache file for incremental analysis if any, creates the new cache
 *   <li> Report creation: creates a report object for the rules to act on
 *   <li> File collection: collects the files to analyse and dispatches them to worker threads.
 *        Each file undergoes the steps described above.
 *   <li> Report rendering
 *   <li> Cache persisting
 * </ul>
