make sure code is up to date and everything is in svn:

ant -f bin/build.xml delete
svn update
svn status

run version update script at the top level:

./etc/update_version.sh <version>

    tasks implemented by script:
    update pmd.bat, designer.bat, bgastviewer.*, cpd.jnlp, cpdgui.bat, build.xml to point to pmd-<version>.jar
    update PMD.java, xdocs/running.xml, compiling.xml, integrations.xml, installing.xml to reflect pmd-<version>
    update the release date in the changelog
    update release number and tag name in project.xml

then, run the script that will generate the proper rulesets/rulesets.properties

./etc/updating_rulesets.sh
	update rulesets/rulesets.properties - add any new ruleset file names

ensure all the new rules are listed in a rulesets/releases/<version>.xml file

ant -f bin/build.xml pmdOnPmd

ant -f bin/build.xml clean regress
Check in everything

ant -f bin/build.xml  dist regress regress14
Do all the JUnit tests run?  OK, then:

TESTS: Can you
1) run 1 file and get a report
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java xml unusedcode
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java html rulesets/unusedcode.xml
2) run the Ant 'pmd' task and get a report
ant -f bin/build.xml pmd

cd into etc/ and run the release script:
$ ./release.sh

It will run:

	ant dist
	./docs.sh all

	generate the binary zip file

	tag svn (unless -s if used)

	generate the source zip file

Note: if you see a bug and fix it, you can delete the release using (and the retag it):
$ svn delete https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/tags/pmd/pmd_release_<version>

Go to Admin, File Releases, Add release
Paste stuff into the changelog/readme boxes
Add the pmd-bin-<version>.zip file
Add the pmd-src-<version>.zip file
Classify the file
Click File Releases, Edit Release, set previous version to 'hidden'.
