Moved BooleanInstantiation from the design ruleset to the basic ruleset.

October 19, 2004 - 2.0:
New rules: InstantiationToGetClass, IdempotentOperationsRule, SuspiciousEqualsMethodName, SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale, JUnitTestsShouldContainAssertsRule, SuspiciousConstantFieldName, ImmutableFieldRule, MoreThanOneLoggerRule, LoggerIsNotStaticFinalRule, UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
Applied patch in RFE 992576 - Enhancements to VariableNamingConventionsRule
Implemented RFE 995910 - The HTML report can now include links to HTMLlized source code - for example, the HTML generated by JXR.
Implemented RFE 665824 - PMD now ignores rule violations in lines containing the string 'NOPMD'.

Added data flow analysis facade from Raik Schroeder.
Added two new optional attributes to rule definitions - symboltable and dfa.  These allow the symbol table and DFA facades to be configured on a rule-by-rule basis.  Note that if your rule needs the symbol table; you'll need to add symboltable="true" to your rule definition.  FWIW, this also results in about a 5% speedup for rules that don't need either layer.
Added a "logging" ruleset - thanks to Miguel Griffa for the code!
Enhanced the ASTViewer - and renamed it 'Designer' - to display data flows.
Moved development environment to Maven 1.0.

Moved LooseCoupling from design.xml to coupling.xml.

Postfix expressions (i.e., x++) are now available in the grammar.  To access them, search for StatementExpressions with an image of "++" or "--" - i.e., in XPath, //StatementExpression[@Image="++"].  This is an odd hack and hopefully will get cleared up later.
Ant task and CLI now used BufferedInputStreams.
Converted AtLeastOneConstructor rule from Java code to XPath.
Implemented RFE 743460: The XML report now contains the ruleset name.
Implemented RFE 958714: Private field and local variables that are assigned but not used are now flagged as unused.
