???? ??, 2012 - 5.1.0:
 
TODO - Release blockers - Must implement before this release can be finally finished

   CODE:
   o PropertyDescriptor final tasks:
      - Find some way to have them appear in the online documentation for the rules
        that have them. Ideally we want to ensure we define them in one place only.
      - Report renderers now inherit from PropertySource so we should migrate the
        old-style property references to use the new style. Ensure we remain
        compatible with the online arguments that get passed in.
   o Need to refactor the test framework to more readily support for multiple
     Languages (too Java-centric at the moment).  Then, need start adding tests
     for the new XML language and other new languages.
   o Need the modify RuleViolation, RuleViolationFactory, and Rule base classes
     to recognize the difference between violations which require a Node, and
     those without.  This is to make certain that Rules which require and do not
     pass, will die with an error because they are buggy and need to be fixed.

   DOCUMENTATION:
   o Expand documentation examples which demonstrate use of new RuleSetReferenceId
     capabilities, specifically interal RuleSet reference in a RuleSet XML, and use
     of a Rule reference in places not previously possible (e.g. CMD and Ant).
   o Fully document the changed/new command line and Ant configuration options.
   o Need to enhance documentation to cover Global and Language specific
     function namespaces required for XPath 2.0 use (e.g. pmd:matches
     and pmd-java:typeof).

January 31, 2012 - 5.0-alpha:

This version of PMD breaks API compatibility with prior versions of PMD, as well
as RuleSet XML compatibility. Also the maven coordinates (groupId) have been changed.
The decision to break compatibility, allows PMD
internals and code organization to be improved to better handle additional
languages.  This opportunity was used to remove depreciated APIs, and beat up
any code which has thumbed its nose at the developers over the years. ;)

The following is relatively complete list of the major changes (this may not be
100% accurate, see actual source code when in doubt):

Fixed bug (no number) - Fixed UseStringBufferLengthRule only worked once per class
All StringBuffer-related rules now also catch StringBuilder-related issues in the same way

New features:

New Language 'ecmascript' added, for writing XPathRule and Java Rules against ECMAScript/JavaScript documents (must be standalone, not embedded in HTML).  Many thanks to Rhino!
New Language 'xml' added, for writing XPathRules against XML documents
New Language 'xsl' added, as a derivative from XML.
Rules can now define a 'violationSuppressRegex' property to universally suppress violations with messages matching the given regular expression
Rules can now define a 'violationSuppressXPath' property to universally suppress violations on nodes which match the given relative XPath expression
Rules are now directly associated with a corresponding Language, and a can also be associated with a specific Language Version range if desired.
Rules can now be flagged with deprecated='true' in the RuleSet XML to allow the PMD Project to indicate a Rule (1) is scheduled for removal, (2) has been removed, or (3) has been renamed/moved.
XPathRules can now query using XPath 2.0 with 'version=2.0"', or XPath 2.0 in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode using 'version="1.0 compatibility"'.  Many thanks to Saxon!
Rules can now use property values in messages, for example ${propertyName} will expand to the value of the 'propertyName' property on the Rule.
Rules can now use violation specific values in messages, specifically ${variableName}, ${methodName}, ${className}, ${packageName}.
New XPath function 'getCommentOn' can be used to search for strings in comments - Thanks to Andy Throgmorton

CPD:
Add .hxx and .hpp as valid file extension for CPD - Thanks to Ryan Pavlik

Performance enhacement when parsing Javadoc (Patch ID: 3217201), thanks to Cd-Man
Rework the XMLRenderer to use proper XML API and strictly uses the system value for encoding (Fix bug: 1435751)

Other changes:
Rule property API upgrades:
  All numeric property descriptors can specify upper & lower limits
  Newly functional Method & Type descriptors allow rule developers to incorporate/watch for individual methods or types
  Better initialization error detection
  Deprecated old string-keyed property API, will leave some methods behind for XPath rules however
'41' and '42' shortcuts for rulesets added
The default Java version processed by PMD is now uniformly Java 1.5.
RuleViolations in Reports now uses List internally, and RuleViolationComparator is no longer broken
TokenManager errors now include a file name whenever possible for every AST in PMD
Added file encoding option to CPD GUI, which already existed for the command line and Ant
AssignmentInOperand enhanced to catch assignment in 'for' condition, as well as use of increment/decrement operators.  Customization properties added to allow assignment in if/while/for, or use of increment/decrement.
Fix false positive on CastExpressions for UselessParentheses
Fix false positive where StringBuffer.setLength(0) was using default constructor size of 16, instead of actual constructor size.
Fix false negative for non-primitive types for VariableNamingConventions, also expanded scope to local and method/constructors, and enhanced customization options to choose between members/locals/parameters (all checked by default)

Moved BooleanInstantiation from the design ruleset to the basic ruleset.
Updated Xerces libraries to v2.6.2.
Many rule names had the word "Rule" tacked on to the end.  Various folks thought this was a bad idea, so here are the new names of those rules which were renamed:

- Good article on features: http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15/

October 19, 2004 - 2.0:
New rules: InstantiationToGetClass, IdempotentOperationsRule, SuspiciousEqualsMethodName, SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale, JUnitTestsShouldContainAssertsRule, SuspiciousConstantFieldName, ImmutableFieldRule, MoreThanOneLoggerRule, LoggerIsNotStaticFinalRule, UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
Applied patch in RFE 992576 - Enhancements to VariableNamingConventionsRule
Implemented RFE 995910 - The HTML report can now include links to HTMLlized source code - for example, the HTML generated by JXR.
Implemented RFE 665824 - PMD now ignores rule violations in lines containing the string 'NOPMD'.
Fixed bug in SimplifyBooleanExpressions - now it catches more cases.

Applied patch 1032927 - The XML report now includes the rule priority.
Added data flow analysis facade from Raik Schroeder.
Added two new optional attributes to rule definitions - symboltable and dfa.  These allow the symbol table and DFA facades to be configured on a rule-by-rule basis.  Note that if your rule needs the symbol table; you'll need to add symboltable="true" to your rule definition.  FWIW, this also results in about a 5% speedup for rules that don't need either layer.
Added a "logging" ruleset - thanks to Miguel Griffa for the code!
Enhanced the ASTViewer - and renamed it 'Designer' - to display data flows.
Moved development environment to Maven 1.0.
Moved development environment to Ant 1.6.2.  This is nice because using the new JUnit task attribute "forkmode='perBatch'" cuts test runtime from 90 seconds to 7 seconds.  Sweet.

Postfix expressions (i.e., x++) are now available in the grammar.  To access them, search for StatementExpressions with an image of "++" or "--" - i.e., in XPath, //StatementExpression[@Image="++"].  This is an odd hack and hopefully will get cleared up later.
Ant task and CLI now used BufferedInputStreams.
Converted AtLeastOneConstructor rule from Java code to XPath.
Implemented RFE 743460: The XML report now contains the ruleset name.
Implemented RFE 958714: Private field and local variables that are assigned but not used are now flagged as unused.
