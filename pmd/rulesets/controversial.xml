<ruleset name="Controversial Rules">
  <description>
The Controversial Ruleset contains rules that, for whatever reason, are considered controversial.  They
are separated out here to allow people to include as they see fit via custom rulesets.  This ruleset was
initially created in response to discussions over UnnecessaryConstructorRule which Tom likes but
most people really dislike :-)

    <rule name="UnnecessaryConstructorRule"
          message="Avoid unnecessary constructors - the compiler will generate these for you"
          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.XPathRule">
      <description>
  Unnecessary constructor detects when a constructor is not necessary; i.e., when there's only one constructor,
  it's public, has an empty body, and takes no arguments.

    <rule name="NullAssignment"
          message="Assigning an Object to null is a code smell.  Consider refactoring."
          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.NullAssignmentRule">
      <description>
 Assigning a "null" to a variable (outside of its declaration) is usually in
 bad form.  Some times, the assignment is an indication that the programmer doesn't
 completely understand what is going on in the code.  NOTE: This sort of assignment
 may in rare cases be useful to encourage garbage collection.  If that's what you're using
 it for, by all means, disregard this rule :-)
