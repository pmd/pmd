   <subsection name="Choose the rules that are right for you">
       <p>Running every ruleset will result in a huge number of rule violations, most of which will be unimportant.
 Having to sort through a thousand line report to find the few you're really interested in takes
 all the fun out of things.</p>
       <p>Instead, start with some of the obvious rulesets - just run <a href="rules/java/unusedcode.html">unusedcode</a>
           and fix any unused locals and fields.
 Then, run <a href="rules/java/basic.html">basic</a> and fix all the empty <code>if</code> statements and such-like.
           Then peruse the <a href="rules/java/design.html">design</a> and
 <a href="rules/java/controversial.html">controversial</a> rulesets and use the ones
           you like <a href="howtomakearuleset.html">via a custom ruleset.</a></p>
   </subsection>

       <subsection name="PMD rules are not set in stone">
           <p>Generally, pick the ones you like, and ignore or <a href="suppressing.html">suppress</a> the warnings you don't like.  It's just a tool.</p>
       </subsection>

       <subsection name="PMD IDE plugins are nice">
           <p>Using PMD within your IDE is much more enjoyable than flipping back and forth
           between an HTML report and your IDE.  Most IDE plugins have the "click on the rule
               violation and jump to that line of code" feature.  Find the PMD plugin for your IDE, install it,
           and soon you'll be fixing problems much faster.</p>
