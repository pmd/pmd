/**
 * BlockMacro directive is used to invoke Velocity macros with normal parameters and a macro body.
 * <p>
 * The macro can then refer to the passed body AST. This directive can be used as a 
 * "decorator". Body AST can contain any valid Velocity syntax.
 *
 * An example:
 * <pre>
 * #set($foobar = "yeah!")
 * 
 * #macro(strong $txt)
 * &lt;strong&gt;$bodyContent&lt;/strong&gt; $txt
 * #end
 *
 * #@strong($foobar)
 * &lt;u&gt;This text is underlined and bold&lt;/u&gt;
 * #end
 * </pre>
 * Will print:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;This text is underlined and bold&lt;u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; yeah!
 * </pre>
 * 
 * bodyContent reference name is configurable (see velocity.properties).
