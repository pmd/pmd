Release Howto for pmd-build:
============================

Prerequisites:
--------------
* You need to have a Jira account at Sonatype: https://issues.sonatype.org/
* You need to have upload permissions to the staging repository for PMD at sonatype: https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-2295
* For more infos: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
* You need a GPG key for signing the artifacts. Use "gpg --list-keys" to see your available keys. Note: Your key must be
  available through various keyservers.
* You need to have your settings.xml filled:
  -> configure the property gpg.keyname and any other property for the maven-gpg-plugin (e.g. via a profile)
  -> configure the server section (you need to configure your sonatype jira account for server id "sonatype-nexus-staging").
* You'll need at least maven 3.0.4, see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MRELEASE-756

Step by step:
-------------
1. Checkout master branch:

git clone https://github.com/pmd/pmd.git
cd pmd/maven-plugin-pmd-build
 
2. Prepare the release (creates a new release tag).
   This will be done for you: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/prepare-release.html
   Maven will ask you about the release version, the tag name and the new version. You can simply hit enter,
   to use the default values.

mvn release:clean
mvn release:prepare

3. Perform the release (builds from the tag and deploys the artifact).

mvn release:perform

4. Release it via Sonatype Nexus
 * Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/
 * Go to Staging Repositories page
 * Select a staging repository
 * Click the close button
 * Now you can download the artifacts again and verify they are working.
 * Once you are sure they are working, click "Release" and the artifacts are eventually available through maven central.

5. Push your local changes if everything is fine

git push origin master
git push origin tag pmd-build/<version>
