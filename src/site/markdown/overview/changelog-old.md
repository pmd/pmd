**CLI Changes:**

*   CPD: If a complete filename is specified, the language dependent filename filter is not applied. This allows
    to scan files, that are not using the standard file extension. If a directory is specified, the filename filter
    is still applied and only those files with the correct file extension of the language are scanned.

**New/Modified/Deprecated Rules:**

The following rules have been
<span style="border-radius: 0.25em; color: #fff; padding: 0.2em 0.6em 0.3em; display: inline; background-color: #5CB85C; font-size: 75%;">enhanced</span>
:

    See also feature [#1320](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1320/).

The following rules are marked as
<span style="border-radius: 0.25em; color: #fff; padding: 0.2em 0.6em 0.3em; display: inline; background-color: #d9534f; font-size: 75%;">deprecated</span>
and will be removed with the next release of PMD.

*   Language Java, ruleset basic.xml: The following rules have been *moved into the `empty.xml` ruleset*. You'll need
    to enable the "empty" ruleset explicitly from now on, if you want to have these rules executed:

    EmptyCatchBlock, EmptyIfStatement, EmptyWhileStmt, EmptyTryBlock, EmptyFinallyBlock, EmptySwitchStatements,
    EmptySynchronizedBlock, EmptyStatementNotInLoop, EmptyInitializer, EmptyStatementBlock, EmptyStaticInitializer.

*   Language Java, ruleset basic.xml: The following rules have been *moved into the `unnecessary.xml` ruleset*. You'll need
    to enable the "unnecessary" ruleset explicitly from now on, if you want to have these rules executed:

    UnnecessaryConversionTemporary, UnnecessaryReturn, UnnecessaryFinalModifier, UselessOverridingMethod,
    UselessOperationOnImmutable, UnusedNullCheckInEquals, UselessParentheses.

*   Language Java, ruleset design.xml: The rule "UncommentedEmptyMethod" *has been renamed* to "UncommentedEmptyMethodBody".
    See also bug [#1283](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1283/).

*   Language Java, ruleset controversial.xml: The rule "BooleanInversion" is deprecated and *will be removed* with
    the next release. See [#1277](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1277/) for more details.

**API Changes:**

*   `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Match.iterator()` now returns an iterator of the new type `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Mark` instead
    of TokenEntry. A `Mark` contains all the informations about each single duplication, including the TokenEntry via `Mark.getToken()`.
    This Mark is useful for reporting the correct line count for each duplication. Previously only one line count was available.
    As for some languages CPD can be instructed to ignore comments, the line count could be different in the different files
    for the same duplication.

*   pmd-test: The utility class `StreamUtil` is deprecated. Just use Apache Commons IO Utils instead.

## October 17, 2014 - 5.2.0:

**Modularization of the source code:**

The source code of pmd was undergoing a major restructuring. Each language is separated
out into its own module. This reduces the size of the artifacts significantly, if only
one language is needed. It also makes it easier, to add new languages as extensions.

Therefore, the maven coordinates needed to change. In order to just use pmd with java support, you'll need
the following two dependencies:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
        <artifactId>pmd-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.sourceforge.pmd</groupId>
        <artifactId>pmd-java</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
    </dependency>

The binary package still contains all languages and can be used as usual. Have a look at
[the central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3Anet.sourceforge.pmd) for available modules.

**New Languages**

* CPD supports now [Go](https://golang.org/).

**Pull requests:**

* [#9](https://github.com/adangel/pmd/pull/9/): New rule: NoUnsanitizedJSPExpressionRule
* [#44](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/44/): Add GoLang support to CPD

**New/Modified Rules:**

* JSP - Basic ruleset:
    * NoUnsanitizedJSPExpression: Using unsanitized JSP expression can lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

* [#1244](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1244/): FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass and anonymous classes

**New/Modified Rules:**

  Ignore Field Declarations, that are initialized with anonymous class declarations. This property is enabled by default.
  See [feature #1244](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1244/).
* ShortClassName (ruleset java-naming) has a new property called `minimum`: Number of characters that are required
  as a minimum for a class name. By default, 5 characters are required - if the class name is shorter, a violation
  will be reported. See [feature #1232](https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1232/).

**CPD Changes:**

- Command Line
    - Added option "--skip-lexical-errors" to skip files, which can't be tokenized
      due to invalid characters instead of aborting CPD. See also [bug 1178].
- Ant
    - New optional parameter "skipDuplicateFiles": Ignore multiple copies of files of the same name and length in
      comparison; defaults to "false".
      This was already a command line option, but now also available in in CPD's ant task.
    - New optional parameter "skipLexicalErros": Skip files which can't be tokenized due to invalid characters
      instead of aborting CPD; defaults to "false".

[bug 1178]: https://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/1178/


## February 11, 2014 - 5.1.0:

**New/Updated Languages:**

- Java 1.8 support added.
- PLSQL support added; thanks to Stuart Turton. See also http://pldoc.sourceforge.net/
- Apache Velocity support added; thanks to Andrey Utis. See also http://velocity.apache.org

**New/Updated Rulesets and Rules:**

- EcmaScript
    - Controversial ruleset, featuring AvoidWithStatement
    - UseBaseWithParseInt
- Java
    - GuardLogStatement
        - replace xpath implementation of GuardDebugLogging by GuardLogStatement (better perf)
    - CommentRequired
        - basic rule to check for existence for formal (javadoc) comments.
    - AvoidProtectedMethodInFinalClassNotExtending
        - rule to avoid protected methods in final classes that don't extend anything other than Object.
    - ConsecutiveAppendsShouldReuse
        - rule to encourage to reuse StringBuilder.append returned object for consecutive calls.
    - PositionLiteralsFirstInCaseInsensitiveComparisons
        - rule similar to PositionLiteralsFirstInComparisons, but for case insensitive comparisons (equalsIgnoreCase).
          Thanks to Larry Diamond
    - ConfusingTernary
        - new property "ignoreElseIf" to suppress this rule in case of if-else-if-else usage.
          See [feature 1161]: Confusing Ternary should skip else if statements (or have a property to do so)
    - FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass
        - new property "ignoreEnumDeclarations" which is enabled by default. This relaxes the rule, so
          that enums can be declared before fields and the rule is not triggered.

    PMD Command Line Changes:
      Improved command line interface (CLI) parsing using JCommander.
      Note: this breaks compatibility, but should be easy to fix.
      With "-d" you specify nowtThe source files / source directory to be scanned.
      With "-f" you select the report format (like text, html, ...)
      With "-R" you select the rulesets to be used.
      Example: pmd -d c:\data\pmd\pmd\test-data\Unused1.java -f xml -R rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml
    
    Improved JSP parser to be less strict with not valid XML documents (like HTML). Thanks to Victor Bucutea.
    Fixed bgastviewer not working. Thanks to Victor Bucutea.
    Improved CPD: Support in CPD for IgnoreAnnotations and SuppressWarnings("CPD-START"). Thanks to Matthew Short.

    CPD:

## January 31, 2012 - 5.0-alpha:

    This version of PMD breaks API compatibility with prior versions of PMD, as well
    as RuleSet XML compatibility. Also the maven coordinates (groupId) have been changed.
    The decision to break compatibility, allows PMD
    internals and code organization to be improved to better handle additional
    languages.  This opportunity was used to remove depreciated APIs, and beat up
    any code which has thumbed its nose at the developers over the years. ;)
    
    The following is relatively complete list of the major changes (this may not be
    100% accurate, see actual source code when in doubt):
    
    Fixed bug (no number) - Fixed UseStringBufferLengthRule only worked once per class
    All StringBuffer-related rules now also catch StringBuilder-related issues in the same way
    
        API Change - Unification of treatment of languages within PMD core:

    New features:
    
    New Language 'ecmascript' added, for writing XPathRule and Java Rules against ECMAScript/JavaScript documents (must be standalone, not embedded in HTML).  Many thanks to Rhino!
    New Language 'xml' added, for writing XPathRules against XML documents
    New Language 'xsl' added, as a derivative from XML.
    Rules can now define a 'violationSuppressRegex' property to universally suppress violations with messages matching the given regular expression
    Rules can now define a 'violationSuppressXPath' property to universally suppress violations on nodes which match the given relative XPath expression
    Rules are now directly associated with a corresponding Language, and a can also be associated with a specific Language Version range if desired.
    Rules can now be flagged with deprecated='true' in the RuleSet XML to allow the PMD Project to indicate a Rule (1) is scheduled for removal, (2) has been removed, or (3) has been renamed/moved.
    XPathRules can now query using XPath 2.0 with 'version=2.0"', or XPath 2.0 in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode using 'version="1.0 compatibility"'.  Many thanks to Saxon!
    Rules can now use property values in messages, for example ${propertyName} will expand to the value of the 'propertyName' property on the Rule.
    Rules can now use violation specific values in messages, specifically ${variableName}, ${methodName}, ${className}, ${packageName}.
    New XPath function 'getCommentOn' can be used to search for strings in comments - Thanks to Andy Throgmorton

      Newly functional Method & Type descriptors allow rule developers to incorporate/watch for individual methods or types
      Better initialization error detection
      Deprecated old string-keyed property API, will leave some methods behind for XPath rules however

    Moved BooleanInstantiation from the design ruleset to the basic ruleset.
    Updated Xerces libraries to v2.6.2.
    Many rule names had the word "Rule" tacked on to the end.  Various folks thought this was a bad idea, so here are the new names of those rules which were renamed:
    - basic.xml: UnnecessaryConversionTemporary, OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode, DoubleCheckedLocking
    - braces.xml: WhileLoopsMustUseBraces, IfElseStmtsMustUseBraces, ForLoopsMustUseBraces

    - strictexception.xml: ExceptionAsFlowControl, AvoidCatchingNPE, AvoidThrowingCertainExceptionTypes
    Continued working on JDK 1.5 compatibility - added support for static import statements, varargs, and the new for loop syntax
    - still TODO: generics and annotations (note that autoboxing shouldn't require a grammar change)
    - Good article on features: http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15/

## October 19, 2004 - 2.0:

    New rules: InstantiationToGetClass, IdempotentOperationsRule, SuspiciousEqualsMethodName, SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale, JUnitTestsShouldContainAssertsRule, SuspiciousConstantFieldName, ImmutableFieldRule, MoreThanOneLoggerRule, LoggerIsNotStaticFinalRule, UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
    Applied patch in RFE 992576 - Enhancements to VariableNamingConventionsRule
    Implemented RFE 995910 - The HTML report can now include links to HTMLlized source code - for example, the HTML generated by JXR.
    Implemented RFE 665824 - PMD now ignores rule violations in lines containing the string 'NOPMD'.
    Fixed bug in SimplifyBooleanExpressions - now it catches more cases.
    Fixed bugs in AvoidDuplicateLiterals - now it ignores small duplicate literals, its message is more helpful, and it catches more cases.
    Fixed bug 997893 - UnusedPrivateField now detects assignments to members of private fields as a usage.
    Fixed bug 1020199 - UnusedLocalVariable no longer flags arrays as unused if an assignment is made to an array slot.

    Applied patch 1032927 - The XML report now includes the rule priority.
    Added data flow analysis facade from Raik Schroeder.
    Added two new optional attributes to rule definitions - symboltable and dfa.  These allow the symbol table and DFA facades to be configured on a rule-by-rule basis.  Note that if your rule needs the symbol table; you'll need to add symboltable="true" to your rule definition.  FWIW, this also results in about a 5% speedup for rules that don't need either layer.
    Added a "logging" ruleset - thanks to Miguel Griffa for the code!
    Enhanced the ASTViewer - and renamed it 'Designer' - to display data flows.
    Moved development environment to Maven 1.0.
    Moved development environment to Ant 1.6.2.  This is nice because using the new JUnit task attribute "forkmode='perBatch'" cuts test runtime from 90 seconds to 7 seconds.  Sweet.
