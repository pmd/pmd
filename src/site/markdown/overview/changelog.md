### New and noteworthy

###Â Java Type Resolution

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Bendeguz Nagy](https://github.com/WinterGrascph) has been working on completing type resolution for Java.
His progress so far has allowed to properly resolve, in addition to previously supported statements:

 - References to `this` and `super`, even when qualified
 - References to fields, even when chained (ie: `this.myObject.aField`), and properly handling inheritance / shadowing

Fields using generics are still Work in Progress, but we expect to fully support it soon enough.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryFinalModifier` (ruleset java-unnecessary) now also reports on private methods marked as `final`.
    Being private, such methods can't be overriden, and therefore, the final keyword is redundant.

*   The Java rule `PreserveStackTrace` (ruleset java-design) has been relaxed to support the builder pattern on thrown exception.
    This change may introduce some false positives if using the exception in non-orthodox ways for things other than setting the
    root cause of the exception. Contact us if you find any such scenarios.

*   The ruleset java-junit now properly detects JUnit5, and rules are being adapted to the changes on it's API.
    This support is, however, still incomplete. Let us know of any uses we are still missing on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues)
